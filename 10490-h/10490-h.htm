<i>Night and storm.</i> LUCIFER, <i>with the Powers of the
Air, trying to tear down the Cross.</i><p><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> HASTEN! hasten!<br>
O ye spirits!<br>
From its station drag the ponderous<br>
Cross of iron, that to mock us<br>
Is uplifted high in air!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Voices.</i> O, we cannot!<br>
For around it<br>
All the Saints and Guardian Angels<br>
Throng in legions to protect it;<br>
They defeat us everywhere!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Bells.</i> Laudo Deum verum<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plebem voco!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congrego clerum!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Lower! lower!<br>
Hover downward!<br>
Seize the loud, vociferous bells, and<br>
Clashing, clanging, to the pavement<br>
Hurl them from their windy tower!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Voices.</i> All thy thunders<br>
Here are harmless!<br>
For these bells have been anointed,<br>
And baptized with holy water!<br>
They defy our utmost power.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Bells.</i> Defunctos ploro!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pestem fugo!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Festa decoro!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Shake the casements!<br>
Break the painted<br>
Panes that flame with gold and crimson!<br>
Scatter them like leaves of Autumn,<br>
Swept away before the blast!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Voices.</i> O, we cannot!<br>
The Archangel<br>
Michael flames from every window,<br>
With the sword of fire that drove us<br>
Headlong, out of heaven, aghast!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Bells.</i> Funera plango!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fulgora frango!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabbata pango!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Aim your lightnings<br>
At the oaken,<br>
Massive, iron-studded portals!<br>
Sack the house of God, and scatter<br>
Wide the ashes of the dead!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Voices.</i> O, we cannot!<br>
The Apostles<br>
And the Martyrs, wrapped in mantles,<br>
Stand as wardens at the entrance,<br>
Stand as sentinels o'erhead!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Bells.</i> Excito lentos!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dissipo ventos!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paco cruentos!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Baffled! baffled!<br>
Inefficient,<br>
Craven spirits! leave this labor<br>
Unto Time, the great Destroyer!<br>
Come away, ere night is gone!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Voices.</i> Onward! onward!<br>
With the night-wind,<br>
Over field and farm and forest,<br>
Lonely homestead, darksome hamlet,<br>
Blighting all we breathe upon!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>They sweep away. Organ and Gregorian Chant.</i>)<br><p></p>

<H2>THE CASTLE OF VAUTSBERG ON THE RHINE.</h2>

<hr style="width: 25%;">

<i>A chamber in a tower.</i> PRINCE HENRY, <i>sitting alone,
ill and restless.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> I cannot sleep! my fervid brain<br>
Calls up the vanished Past again,<br>
And throws its misty splendors deep<br>
Into the pallid realms of sleep!<br>
A breath from that far-distant shore<br>
Comes freshening ever more and more,<br>
And wafts o'er intervening seas<br>
Sweet odors from the Hesperides!<br>
A wind, that through the corridor<br>
Just stirs the curtain, and no more,<br>
And, touching the aeolian strings,<br>
Faints with the burden that it brings!<br>
Come back! ye friendships long departed!<br>
That like o'erflowing streamlets started,<br>
And now are dwindled, one by one,<br>
To stony channels in the sun!<br>
Come back! ye friends, whose lives are ended!<br>
Come back, with all that light attended,<br>
Which seemed to darken and decay<br>
When ye arose and went away!<br>
They come, the shapes of joy and woe,<br>
The airy crowds of long-ago,<br>
The dreams and fancies known of yore,<br>
That have been, and shall be no more.<br>
They change the cloisters of the night<br>
Into a garden of delight;<br>
They make the dark and dreary hours<br>
Open and blossom into flowers!<br>
I would not sleep! I love to be<br>
Again in their fair company;<br>
But ere my lips can bid them stay,<br>
They pass and vanish quite away!<p></p>

Alas! our memories may retrace<br>
Each circumstance of time and place,<br>
Season and scene come back again,<br>
And outward things unchanged remain;<br>
The rest we cannot reinstate;<br>
Ourselves we cannot re-create,<br>
Nor set our souls to the same key<br>
Of the remembered harmony!<p></p>

Rest! rest! O, give me rest and peace!<br>
The thought of life that ne'er shall cease<br>
Has something in it like despair,<br>
A weight I am too weak to bear!<br>
Sweeter to this afflicted breast<br>
The thought of never-ending rest!<br>
Sweeter the undisturbed and deep<br>
Tranquillity of endless sleep!<p></p>
<br>

(<i>A flash of lightning, out of which</i> LUCIFER <i>appears,
in the garb of a travelling Physician.</i>)<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. All hail Prince Henry!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> (<i>starting</i>). Who is it speaks?<br>
Who and what are you?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. One who seeks<br>
A moment's audience with the Prince.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. When came you in?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. A moment since.<br>
I found your study door unlocked,<br>
And thought you answered when I knocked.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. I did not hear you.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. You heard the thunder;<br>
It was loud enough to waken the dead.<br>
And it is not a matter of special wonder<br>
That, when God is walking overhead,<br>
You should not have heard my feeble tread.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. What may your wish or purpose be?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. Nothing or everything, as it pleases<br>
Your Highness. You behold in me<br>
Only a traveling Physician;<br>
One of the few who have a mission<br>
To cure incurable diseases,<br>
Or those that are called so.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. Can you bring<br>
The dead to life?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. Yes; very nearly.<br>
And, what is a wiser and better thing,<br>
Can keep the living from ever needing<br>
Such an unnatural, strange proceeding,<br>
By showing conclusively and clearly<br>
That death is a stupid blunder merely,<br>
And not a necessity of our lives.<br>
My being here is accidental;<br>
The storm, that against your casement drives,<br>
In the little village below waylaid me.<br>
And there I heard, with a secret delight,<br>
Of your maladies physical and mental,<br>
Which neither astonished nor dismayed me.<br>
And I hastened hither, though late in the night,<br>
To proffer my aid!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry (ironically)</i> For this you came!<br>
Ah, how can I ever hope to requite<br>
This honor from one so erudite?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. The honor is mine, or will be when<br>
I have cured your disease.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. But not till then.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. What is your illness?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. It has no name.<br>
A smouldering, dull, perpetual flame,<br>
As in a kiln, burns in my veins,<br>
Sending up vapors to the head,<br>
My heart has become a dull lagoon,<br>
Which a kind of leprosy drinks and drains;<br>
I am accounted as one who is dead,<br>
And, indeed, I think that I shall be soon.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i> And has Gordonius the Divine,<br>
In his famous Lily of Medicine,--<br>
I see the book lies open before you,--<br>
No remedy potent enough to restore you?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. None whatever!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i> The dead are dead,<br>
And their oracles dumb, when questioned<br>
Of the new diseases that human life<br>
Evolves in its progress, rank and rife.<br>
Consult the dead upon things that were,<br>
But the living only on things that are.<br>
Have you done this, by the appliance<br>
And aid of doctors?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. Ay, whole schools<br>
Of doctors, with their learned rules,<br>
But the case is quite beyond their science.<br>
Even the doctors of Salern<br>
Send me back word they can discern<br>
No cure for a malady like this,<br>
Save one which in its nature is<br>
Impossible, and cannot be!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds oracular!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> Unendurable!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is their remedy?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall see;<br>
Writ in this scroll is the mystery.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (reading).</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not to be cured, yet not incurable!<br>
The only remedy that remains<br>
Is the blood that flows from a maiden's veins,<br>
Who of her own free will shall die,<br>
And give her life as the price of yours!&quot;<br>
That is the strangest of all cures,<br>
And one, I think, you will never try;<br>
The prescription you may well put by,<br>
As something impossible to find<br>
Before the world itself shall end!<br>
And yet who knows? One cannot say<br>
That into some maiden's brain that kind<br>
Of madness will not find its way.<br>
Meanwhile permit me to recommend,<br>
As the matter admits of no delay,<br>
My wonderful Catholicon,<br>
Of very subtile and magical powers!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Purge with your nostrums and drugs infernal<br>
The spouts and gargoyles of these towers,<br>
Not me! My faith is utterly gone<br>
In every power but the Power Supernal!<br>
Pray tell me, of what school are you?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of the Old and of the New!<br>
The school of Hermes Trismegistus,<br>
Who uttered his oracles sublime<br>
Before the Olympiads, in the dew<br>
Of the early dawn and dusk of Time,<br>
The reign of dateless old Hephaestus!<br>
As northward, from its Nubian springs,<br>
The Nile, forever new and old,<br>
Among the living and the dead,<br>
Its mighty, mystic stream has rolled;<br>
So, starting from its fountain-head<br>
Under the lotus-leaves of Isis,<br>
From the dead demigods of eld,<br>
Through long, unbroken lines of kings<br>
Its course the sacred art has held,<br>
Unchecked, unchanged by man's devices.<br>
This art the Arabian Geber taught,<br>
And in alembics, finely wrought,<br>
Distilling herbs and flowers, discovered<br>
The secret that so long had hovered<br>
Upon the misty verge of Truth,<br>
The Elixir of Perpetual Youth,<br>
Called Alcohol, in the Arab speech!<br>
Like him, this wondrous lore I teach!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;What! an adept?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Nor less, nor more!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a reader of such books,<br>
A lover of that mystic lore!<br>
With such a piercing glance it looks<br>
Into great Nature's open eye,<br>
And sees within it trembling lie<br>
The portrait of the Deity!<br>
And yet, alas! with all my pains,<br>
The secret and the mystery<br>
Have baffled and eluded me,<br>
Unseen the grand result remains!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (showing a flask).</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold it here! this little flask<br>
Contains the wonderful quintessence,<br>
The perfect flower and efflorescence,<br>
Of all the knowledge man can ask!<br>
Hold it up thus against the light!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How limpid, pure, and crystalline,<br>
How quick, and tremulous, and bright<br>
The little wavelets dance and shine,<br>
As were it the Water of Life in sooth!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> It is! It assuages every pain,<br>
Cures all disease, and gives again<br>
To age the swift delights of youth.<br>
Inhale its fragrance.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> It is sweet.<br>
A thousand different odors meet<br>
And mingle in its rare perfume,<br>
Such as the winds of summer waft<br>
At open windows through a room!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you not taste it?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Will one draught Suffice?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> If not, you can drink more.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Into this crystal goblet pour<br>
So much as safely I may drink.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (pouring).</i> Let not the quantity alarm you:<br>
You may drink all; it will not harm you.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as one who on the brink<br>
Of a dark river stands and sees<br>
The waters flow, the landscape dim<br>
Around him waver, wheel, and swim,<br>
And, ere he plunges, stops to think<br>
Into what whirlpools he may sink;<br>
One moment pauses, and no more,<br>
Then madly plunges from the shore!<br>
Headlong into the dark mysteries<br>
Of life and death I boldly leap,<br>
Nor fear the fateful current's sweep,<br>
Nor what in ambush lurks below!<br>
For death is better than disease!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>An</i> ANGEL <i>with an aeolian harp hovers in the air</i>.)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Angel.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe! woe! eternal woe!<br>
Not only the whispered prayer<br>
Of love,<br>
But the imprecations of hate,<br>
Reverberate<br>
Forever and ever through the air<br>
Above!<br>
This fearful curse<br>
Shakes the great universe!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (disappearing).</i> Drink! drink!<br>
And thy soul shall sink<br>
Down into the dark abyss,<br>
Into the infinite abyss,<br>
From which no plummet nor rope<br>
Ever drew up the silver sand of hope!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry (drinking).</i> It is like a draught of fire!<br>
Through every vein<br>
I feel again<br>
The fever of youth, the soft desire;<br>
A rapture that is almost pain<br>
Throbs in my heart and fills my brain!<br>
O joy! O joy! I feel<br>
The band of steel<br>
That so long and heavily has pressed<br>
Upon my breast<br>
Uplifted, and the malediction<br>
Of my affliction<br>
Is taken from me, and my weary breast<br>
At length finds rest.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Angel.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is but the rest of the fire, from which the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been taken!<br>
It is but the rest of the sand, when the hour-glass is not shaken!<br>
It is but the rest of the tide between the ebb and the flow!<br>
It is but the rest of the wind between the flaws that blow!<br>
With fiendish laughter,<br>
Hereafter,<br>
This false physician<br>
Will mock thee in thy perdition.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Speak! speak!<br>
Who says that I am ill?<br>
I am not ill! I am not weak!<br>
The trance, the swoon, the dream, is o'er!<br>
I feel the chill of death no more!<br>
At length,<br>
I stand renewed in all my strength!<br>
Beneath me I can feel<br>
The great earth stagger and reel,<br>
As it the feet of a descending God<br>
Upon its surface trod,<br>
And like a pebble it rolled beneath his heel!<br>
This, O brave physician! this<br>
Is thy great Palingenesis!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Drinks again</i>.)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Angel.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch the goblet no more!<br>
It will make thy heart sore<br>
To its very core!<br>
Its perfume is the breath<br>
Of the Angel of Death,<br>
And the light that within it lies<br>
Is the flash of his evil eyes.<br>
Beware! O, beware!<br>
For sickness, sorrow, and care<br>
All are there!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry (sinking back).</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou voice within my breast!<br>
Why entreat me, why upbraid me,<br>
When the steadfast tongues of truth<br>
And the flattering hopes of youth<br>
Have all deceived me and betrayed me?<br>
Give me, give me rest, O, rest!<br>
Golden visions wave and hover,<br>
Golden vapors, waters streaming,<br>
Landscapes moving, changing, gleaming!<br>
I am like a happy lover<br>
Who illumines life with dreaming!<br>
Brave physician! Rare physician!<br>
Well hast thou fulfilled thy mission!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>His head falls On his book</i>.)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Angel (receding).</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! alas!<br>
Like a vapor the golden vision<br>
Shall fade and pass,<br>
And thou wilt find in thy heart again<br>
Only the blight of pain,<br>
And bitter, bitter, bitter contrition!<p></p>

<H2>COURT-YARD OF THE CASTLE.</H2>

<hr style="width: 25%;">

HUBERT <i>standing by the gateway.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How sad the grand old castle looks!<br>
O'erhead, the unmolested rooks<br>
Upon the turret's windy top<br>
Sit, talking of the farmer's crop;<br>
Here in the court-yard springs the grass,<br>
So few are now the feet that pass;<br>
The stately peacocks, bolder grown,<br>
Come hopping down the steps of stone,<br>
As if the castle were their own;<br>
And I, the poor old seneschal,<br>
Haunt, like a ghost, the banquet-hall.<br>
Alas! the merry guests no more<br>
Crowd through the hospital door;<br>
No eyes with youth and passion shine,<br>
No cheeks glow redder than the wine;<br>
No song, no laugh, no jovial din<br>
Of drinking wassail to the pin;<br>
But all is silent, sad, and drear,<br>
And now the only sounds I hear<br>
Are the hoarse rooks upon the walls,<br>
And horses stamping in their stalls!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>A horn sounds</i>.)<br><p></p>

What ho! that merry, sudden blast<br>
Reminds me of the days long past!<br><
And, as of old resounding, grate<br>
The heavy hinges of the gate,<br>
And, clattering loud, with iron clank,<br>
Down goes the sounding bridge of plank,<br>
As if it were in haste to greet<br>
The pressure of a traveler's feet!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Enter</i> WALTER <i>the Minnesinger</i>.)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How now, my friend! This looks quite lonely!<br>
No banner flying from the walls,<br>
No pages and no seneschals,<br>
No wardens, and one porter only!<br>
Is it you, Hubert?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Master Walter!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! how forms and faces alter!<br>
I did not know you. You look older!<br>
Your hair has grown much grayer and thinner,<br>
And you stoop a little in the shoulder!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i> Alack! I am a poor old sinner,<br>
And, like these towers, begin to moulder;<br>
And you have been absent many a year!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the Prince?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not here;<br>
He has been ill: and now has fled.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter.</i>  Speak it out frankly: say he's dead!<br>
Is it not so?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;No; if you please;<br>
A strange, mysterious disease<br>
Fell on him with a sudden blight.<br>
Whole hours together he would stand<br>
Upon the terrace, in a dream,<br>
Resting his head upon his hand,<br>
Best pleased when he was most alone,<br>
Like Saint John Nepomuck in stone,<br>
Looking down into a stream.<br>
In the Round Tower, night after night,<br>
He sat, and bleared his eyes with books;<br>
Until one morning we found him there<br>
Stretched on the floor, as if in a swoon<br>
He had fallen from his chair.<br>
We hardly recognized his sweet looks!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Prince!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he might have mended;<br>
And he did mend; but very soon<br>
The Priests came flocking in, like rooks,<br>
With all their crosiers and their crooks,<br>
And so at last the matter ended.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How did it end?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, in Saint Rochus<br>
They made him stand, and wait his doom;<br>
And, as if he were condemned to the tomb,<br>
Began to mutter their hocus pocus.<br>
First, the Mass for the Dead they chaunted.<br>
Then three times laid upon his head<br>
A shovelful of church-yard clay,<br>
Saying to him, as he stood undaunted,<br>
&quot;This is a sign that thou art dead,<br>
So in thy heart be penitent!&quot;<br>
And forth from the chapel door he went<br>
Into disgrace and banishment,<br>
Clothed in a cloak of hodden gray,<br>
And bearing a wallet, and a bell,<br>
Whose sound should be a perpetual knell<br>
To keep all travelers away.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter.</i> O, horrible fate! Outcast, rejected,<br>
As one with pestilence infected!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i> Then was the family tomb unsealed,<br>
And broken helmet, sword and shield,<br>
Buried together, in common wreck,<br>
As is the custom, when the last<br>
Of any princely house has passed,<br>
And thrice, as with a trumpet-blast,<br>
A herald shouted down the stair<br>
The words of warning and despair,--<br>
&quot;O Hoheneck! O Hoheneck!&quot;<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter</i>. Still in my soul that cry goes on,--<br>
Forever gone! forever gone!<br>
Ah, what a cruel sense of loss,<br>
Like a black shadow, would fall across<br>
The hearts of all, if he should die!<br>
His gracious presence upon earth<br>
Was as a fire upon a hearth;<br>
As pleasant songs, at morning sung,<br>
The words that dropped from his sweet tongue<br>
Strengthened our hearts; or, heard at night,<br>
Made all our slumbers soft and light.<br>
Where is he?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hubert.</i> In the Odenwald.<br>
Some of his tenants, unappalled<br>
By fear of death, or priestly word,--<br>
A holy family, that make<br>
Each meal a Supper of the Lord,--<br>
Have him beneath their watch and ward,<br>
For love of him, and Jesus' sake!<br>
Pray you come in. For why should I<br>
With outdoor hospitality<br>
My prince's friend thus entertain?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would a moment here remain.<br>
But you, good Hubert, go before,<br>
Fill me a goblet of May-drink,<br>
As aromatic as the May<br>
From which it steals the breath away,<br>
And which he loved so well of yore;<br>
It is of him that I would think<br>
You shall attend me, when I call,<br>
In the ancestral banquet hall.<br>
Unseen companions, guests of air,<br>
You cannot wait on, will be there;<br>
They taste not food, they drink not wine,<br>
But their soft eyes look into mine,<br>
And their lips speak to me, and all<br>
The vast and shadowy banquet-hall<br>
Is full of looks and words divine!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Leaning over the parapet</i>.)<br><p></p>

The day is done; and slowly from the scene<br>
The stooping sun upgathers his spent shafts,<br>
And puts them back into his golden quiver!<br>
Below me in the valley, deep and green<br>
As goblets are, from which in thirsty draughts<br>
We drink its wine, the swift and mantling river<br>
Flows on triumphant through these lovely regions,<br>
Etched with the shadows of its sombre margent,<br>
And soft, reflected clouds of gold and argent!<br>
Yes, there it flows, forever, broad and still,<br>
As when the vanguard of the Roman legions<br>
First saw it from the top of yonder hill!<br>
How beautiful it is! Fresh fields of wheat,<br>
Vineyard, and town, and tower with fluttering flag,<br>
The consecrated chapel on the crag,<br>
And the white hamlet gathered round its base,<br>
Like Mary sitting at her Saviour's feet,<br>
And looking up at his beloved face!<br>
O friend! O best of friends! Thy absence more<br>
Than the impending night darkens the landscape o'er!<p></p>

<i>A garden; morning;</i> PRINCE HENRY <i>seated, with a
book</i>. ELSIE, <i>at a distance, gathering flowers.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry (reading).</i> One morning, all alone,<br>
Out of his convent of gray stone,<br>
Into the forest older, darker, grayer,<br>
His lips moving as if in prayer,<br>
His head sunken upon his breast<br>
As in a dream of rest,<br>
Walked the Monk Felix. All about<br>
The broad, sweet sunshine lay without,<br>
Filling the summer air;<br>
And within the woodlands as he trod,<br>
The twilight was like the Truce of God<br>
With worldly woe and care;<br>
Under him lay the golden moss;<br>
And above him the boughs of hemlock-tree<br>
Waved, and made the sign of the cross,<br>
And whispered their Benedicites;<br>
And from the ground<br>
Rose an odor sweet and fragrant<br>
Of the wild flowers and the vagrant<br>
Vines that wandered,<br>
Seeking the sunshine, round and round.<br>
These he heeded not, but pondered<br>
On the volume in his hand,<br>
A volume of Saint Augustine;<br>
Wherein he read of the unseen<br>
Splendors of God's great town<br>
In the unknown land,<br>
And, with his eyes cast down<br>
In humility, he said:<br>
&quot;I believe, O God,<br>
What herein I have read,<br>
But alas! I do not understand!&quot;<p></p>

And lo! he heard<br>
The sudden singing of a bird,<br>
A snow-white bird, that from a cloud<br>
Dropped down,<br>
And among the branches brown<br>
Sat singing<br>
So sweet, and clear, and loud,<br>
It seemed a thousand harp strings ringing.<br>
And the Monk Felix closed his book,<br>
And long, long,<br>
With rapturous look,<br>
He listened to the song,<br>
And hardly breathed or stirred,<br>
Until he saw, as in a vision,<br>
The land Elysian,<br>
And in the heavenly city heard<br>
Angelic feet<br>
Fall on the golden flagging of the street.<br>
And he would fain<br>
Have caught the wondrous bird,<br>
But strove in vain;<br>
For it flew away, away,<br>
Far over hill and dell,<br>
And instead of its sweet singing<br>
He heard the convent bell<br>
Suddenly in the silence ringing<br>
For the service of noonday.<br>
And he retraced<br>
His pathway homeward sadly and in haste.<p><p></p>

In the convent there was a change!<br>
He looked for each well known face,<br>
But the faces were new and strange;<br>
New figures sat in the oaken stalls,<br>
New voices chaunted in the choir,<br>
Yet the place was the same place,<br>
The same dusky walls<br>
Of cold, gray stone,<br>
The same cloisters and belfry and spire.<p></p>

A stranger and alone<br>
Among that brotherhood<br>
The Monk Felix stood<br>
&quot;Forty years,&quot; said a Friar.<br>
&quot;Have I been Prior<br>
Of this convent in the wood,<br>
But for that space<br>
Never have I beheld thy face!&quot;<p></p>

The heart of the Monk Felix fell:<br>
And he answered with submissive tone,<br>
&quot;This morning, after the hour of Prime,<br>
I left my cell,<br>
And wandered forth alone,<br>
Listening all the time<br>
To the melodious singing<br>
Of a beautiful white bird,<br>
Until I heard<br>
The bells of the convent ringing<br>
Noon from their noisy towers,<br>
It was as if I dreamed;<br>
For what to me had seemed<br>
Moments only, had been hours!&quot;<p></p>

&quot;Years!&quot; said a voice close by.<br>
It was an aged monk who spoke,<br>
From a bench of oak<br>
Fastened against the wall;--<br>
He was the oldest monk of all.<br>
For a whole century<br>
Had he been there,<br>
Serving God in prayer,<br>
The meekest and humblest of his creatures.<br>
He remembered well the features<br>
Of Felix, and he said,<br>
Speaking distinct and slow:<br>
&quot;One hundred years ago,<br>
When I was a novice in this place,<br>
There was here a monk, full of God's grace,<br>
Who bore the name<br>
Of Felix, and this man must be the same.&quot;<p></p>

And straightway<br>
They brought forth to the light of day<br>
A volume old and brown,<br>
A huge tome, bound<br>
With brass and wild-boar's hide,<br>
Therein were written down<br>
The names of all who had died<br>
In the convent, since it was edified.<br>
And there they found,<br>
Just as the old monk said,<br>
That on a certain day and date,<br>
One hundred years before,<br>
Had gone forth from the convent gate<br>
The Monk Felix, and never more<br>
Had entered that sacred door.<br>
He had been counted among the dead!<br>
And they knew, at last,<br>
That, such had been the power<br>
Of that celestial and immortal song,<br>
A hundred years had passed,<br>
And had not seemed so long<br>
As a single hour!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ELSIE <i>comes in with flowers.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Here are flowers for you,<br>
But they are not all for you.<br>
Some of them are for the Virgin<br>
And for Saint Cecilia.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> As thou standest there,<br>
Thou seemest to me like the angel<br>
That brought the immortal roses<br>
To Saint Cecilia's bridal chamber.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> But these will fade.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Themselves will fade,<br>
But not their memory,<br>
And memory has the power<br>
To re-create them from the dust.<br>
They remind me, too,<br>
Of martyred Dorothea,<br>
Who from celestial gardens sent<br>
Flowers as her witnesses<br>
To him who scoffed and doubted.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Do you know the story<br>
Of Christ and the Sultan's daughter?<br>
That is the prettiest legend of them all.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Then tell it to me.<br>
But first come hither.<br>
Lay the flowers down beside me.<br>
And put both thy hands in mine.<br>
Now tell me the story.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Early in the morning<br>
The Sultan's daughter<br>
Walked in her father's garden,<br>
Gathering the bright flowers,<br>
All full of dew.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Just as thou hast been doing<br>
This morning, dearest Elsie.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> And as she gathered them,<br>
She wondered more and more<br>
Who was the Master of the Flowers,<br>
And made them grow<br>
Out of the cold, dark earth.<br>
&quot;In my heart,&quot; she said,<br>
&quot;I love him; and for him<br>
Would leave my father's palace,<br>
To labor in his garden.&quot;<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Dear, innocent child!<br>
How sweetly thou recallest<br>
The long-forgotten legend,<br>
That in my early childhood<br>
My mother told me!<br>
Upon my brain<br>
It reappears once more,<br>
As a birth-mark on the forehead<br>
When a hand suddenly<br>
Is laid upon it, and removed!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> And at midnight,<br>
As she lay upon her bed,<br>
She heard a voice<br>
Call to her from the garden,<br>
And, looking forth from her window,<br>
She saw a beautiful youth<br>
Standing among the flowers.<br>
It was the Lord Jesus;<br>
And she went down to him,<br>
And opened the door for him;<br>
And he said to her, &quot;O maiden!<br>
Thou hast thought of me with love,<br>
And for thy sake<br>
Out of my Father's kingdom<br>
Have I come hither:<br>
I am the Master of the Flowers.<br>
My garden is in Paradise,<br>
And if thou wilt go with me,<br>
Thy bridal garland<br>
Shall be of bright red flowers.&quot;<br>
And then he took from his finger<br>
A golden ring,<br>
And asked the Sultan's daughter<br>
If she would be his bride.<br>
And when she answered him with love,<br>
His wounds began to bleed,<br>
And she said to him,<br>
&quot;O Love! how red thy heart is,<br>
And thy hands are full of roses,&quot;<br>
&quot;For thy sake,&quot; answered he,<br>
&quot;For thy sake is my heart so red,<br>
For thee I bring these roses.<br>
I gathered them at the cross<br>
Whereon I died for thee!<br>
Come, for my Father calls.<br>
Thou art my elected bride!&quot;<br>
And the Sultan's daughter<br>
Followed him to his Father's garden.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Wouldst thou have done so, Elsie?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Yes, very gladly.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Then the Celestial Bridegroom<br>
Will come for thee also.<br>
Upon thy forehead he will place,<br>
Not his crown of thorns,<br>
But a crown of roses.<br>
In thy bridal chamber,<br>
Like Saint Cecilia,<br>
Thou shall hear sweet music,<br>
And breathe the fragrance<br>
Of flowers immortal!<br>
Go now and place these flowers<br>
Before her picture.<p></p>

And a voice cried &quot;Elsie&quot; in my ear!<br>
It startled me, it seemed so near.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> I was calling her: I want a light.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry (at the door)</i>. Amen!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula</i>. Who was it said Amen?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i>. It was the Prince: he stood at the door,<br>
And listened a moment, as we chaunted<br>
The evening song. He is gone again.<br>
I have often seen him there before.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula</i>. Poor Prince!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb</i>. I thought the house was haunted!<br>
Poor Prince, alas! and yet as mild<br>
And patient as the gentlest child!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Max.</i> I love him because he is so good,<br>
And makes me such fine bows and arrows,<br>
To shoot at the robins and the sparrows,<br>
And the red squirrels in the wood!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bertha.</i> I love him, too!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> Ah, yes! we all<br>
Love him, from the bottom of our hearts;<br>
He gave us the farm, the house, and the grange,<br>
He gave us the horses and the carts,<br>
And the great oxen in the stall,<br>
The vineyard, and the forest range!<br>
We have nothing to give him but our love!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bertha.</i> Did he give us the beautiful stork above<br>
On the chimney-top, with its large, round nest?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> No, not the stork; by God in heaven,<br>
As a blessing, the dear, white stork was given;<br>
But the Prince has given us all the rest.<br>
God bless him, and make him well again.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Would I could do something for his sake,<br>
Something to cure his sorrow and pain!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> That no one can; neither thou nor I,<br>
Nor any one else.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> And must he die?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Yes; if the dear God does not take<br>
Pity upon him, in his distress,<br>
And work a miracle!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> Or unless<br>
Some maiden, of her own accord,<br>
Offers her life for that of her lord,<br>
And is willing to die in his stead.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> I will!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Prithee, thou foolish child, be still!<br>
Thou shouldst not say what thou dost not mean!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> I mean it truly!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Max.</i> O father! this morning,<br>
Down by the mill, in the ravine,<br>
Hans killed a wolf, the very same<br>
That in the night to the sheepfold came,<br>
And ate up my lamb, that was left outside.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> I am glad he is dead. It will be a warning<br>
To the wolves in the forest, far and wide.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Max.</i> And I am going to have his hide!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bertha.</i> I wonder if this is the wolf that ate<br>
Little Red Ridinghood!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> O, no!<br>
That wolf was killed a long while ago.<br>
Come, children, it is growing late.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Max.</i> Ah, how I wish I were a man,<br>
As stout as Hans is, and as strong!<br>
I would do nothing else, the whole day long,<br>
But just kill wolves.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> Then go to bed,<br>
And grow as fast as a little boy can.<br>
Bertha is half asleep already.<br>
See how she nods her heavy head,<br>
And her sleepy feet are so unsteady<br>
She will hardly be able to creep upstairs.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Good-night, my children. Here's the light.<br>
And do not forget to say your prayers<br>
Before you sleep.<p></p>

That Elsie of ours. She looks so old,<br>
And thoughts and fancies weird and wild<br>
Seem of late to have taken hold<br>
Of her heart, that was once so docile and mild!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> She is like all girls.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Ah no, forsooth!<br>
Unlike all I have ever seen.<br>
For she has visions and strange dreams,<br>
And in all her words and ways, she seems<br>
Much older than she is in truth.<br>
Who would think her but fourteen?<br>
And there has been of late such a change!<br>
My heart is heavy with fear and doubt<br>
That she may not live till the year is out.<br>
She is so strange,--so strange,--so strange!<p></p>

His healing lies, not in our own;<br>
It is in the hand of God alone.<p></p>

Thou speakest carelessly of death,<br>
And yet thou knowest not what it is.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> 'T is the cessation of our breath.<br>
Silent and motionless we lie;<br>
And no one knoweth more than this.<br>
I saw our little Gertrude die,<br>
She left off breathing, and no more<br>
I smoothed the pillow beneath her head.<br>
She was more beautiful than before.<br>
Like violets faded were her eyes;<br>
By this we knew that she was dead.<br>
Through the open window looked the skies<br>
Into the chamber where she lay,<br>
And the wind was like the sound of wings,<br>
As if angels came to bear her away.<br>
Ah! when I saw and felt these things,<br>
I found it difficult to stay;<br>
I longed to die, as she had died,<br>
And go forth with her, side by side.<br>
The Saints are dead, the Martyrs dead,<br>
And Mary, and our Lord, and I<br>
Would follow in humility<br>
The way by them illumined!<p></p>

The life of woman is full of woe?<br>
Toiling on and on and on,<br>
With breaking heart, and tearful eyes,<br>
And silent lips, and in the soul<br>
The secret longings that arise,<br>
Which this world never satisfies!<br>

Not one quite happy, no, not one!<p></p>

Thy death, beloved, and to stand<br>
Above thy grave! Ah, woe the day!<p></p>

Beneath the flowers of another land,<br>
For at Salerno, far away<br>
Over the mountains, over the sea,<br>
It is appointed me to die!<br>
And it will seem no more to thee<br>
Than if at the village on market-day<br>
I should a little longer stay<br>
Than I am used.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Even as thou sayest!<br>
And how my heart beats, when thou stayest!<br>
I cannot rest until my sight<br>
Is satisfied with seeing thee.<br>
What, then, if thou wert dead?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb</i> Ah me!<br>
Of our old eyes thou art the light!<br>
The joy of our old hearts art thou!<br>
And wilt thou die?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Not now! not now!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ died for me, and shall not I<br>
Be willing for my Prince to die?<br>
You both are silent; you cannot speak.<br>
This said I, at our Saviour's feast,<br>
After confession, to the priest,<br>
And even he made no reply.<br>
Does he not warn us all to seek<br>
The happier, better land on high,<br>
Where flowers immortal never wither,<br>
And could he forbid me to go thither?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> In God's own time, my heart's delight!<br>
When he shall call thee, not before!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> I heard him call. When Christ ascended<br>
Triumphantly, from star to star,<br>
He left the gates of heaven ajar.<br>
I had a vision in the night,<br>
And saw him standing at the door<br>
Of his Father's mansion, vast and splendid,<br>
And beckoning to me from afar.<br>
I cannot stay!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> She speaks almost<br>
As if it were the Holy Ghost<br>
Spake through her lips, and in her stead!<br>
What if this were of God?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Ah, then<br>
Gainsay it dare we not.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb.</i> Amen!<br>
Elsie! the words that thou hast said<br>
Are strange and new for us to hear,<br>
And fill our hearts with doubt and fear.<br>
Whether it be a dark temptation<br>
Of the Evil One, or God's inspiration,<br>
We in our blindness cannot say.<br>
We must think upon it, and pray;<br>
For evil and good in both resembles.<br>
If it be of God, his will be done!<br>
May he guard us from the Evil One!<br>
How hot thy hand is! how it trembles!<br>
Go to thy bed, and try to sleep.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiss me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-night; and do not weep!<br<p>></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ELSIE <i>goes out.</i>)<br><p></p>

Ah, what an awful thing is this!<br>
I almost shuddered at her kiss.<br>
As if a ghost had touched my cheek,<br>
I am so childish and so weak!<br>
As soon as I see the earliest gray<br>
Of morning glimmer in the east,<br>
I will go over to the priest,<br>
And hear what the good man has to say!<p></p>

God maketh thee forever free<br>
From the dominion of thy sin!<br>

walks slowly up and down the church</i>.)<br><p></p>

O blessed Lord! how much I need<br>
Thy light to guide me on my way!<br>
So many hands, that, without heed,<br>
Still touch thy wounds, and make them bleed!<br>
So many feet, that, day by day,<br>
Still wander from thy fold astray!<br>
Unless thou fill me with thy light,<br>
I cannot lead thy flock aright;<br>
Nor, without thy support, can bear<br>
The burden of so great a care,<br>
But am myself a castaway!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>A pause</i>.)<br><p></p>

The day is drawing to its close;<br>
And what good deeds, since first it rose,<br>
Have I presented, Lord, to thee,<br>
As offerings of my ministry?<br>
What wrong repressed, what right maintained<br>
What struggle passed, what victory gained,<br>
What good attempted and attained?<br>
Feeble, at best, is my endeavor!<br>
I see, but cannot reach, the height<br>
That lies forever in the light,<br>
And yet forever and forever,<br>
When seeming just within my grasp,<br>
I feel my feeble hands unclasp,<br>
And sink discouraged into night!<br>
For thine own purpose, thou hast sent<br>
The strife and the discouragement!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>A pause</i>.)<br><p></p>

Why stayest thou, Prince of Hoheneck?<br>
Why keep me pacing to and fro<br>
Amid these aisles of sacred gloom,<br>
Counting my footsteps as I go,<br>
And marking with each step a tomb?<br>
Why should the world for thee make room,<br>
And wait thy leisure and thy beck?<br>
Thou comest in the hope to hear<br>
Some word of comfort and of cheer.<br>
What can I say? I cannot give<br>
The counsel to do this and live;<br>
But rather, firmly to deny<br>
The tempter, though his power is strong,<br>
And, inaccessible to wrong,<br>
Still like a martyr live and die!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>A pause</i>.)<br><p></p>

The evening air grows dusk and brown;<br>
I must go forth into the town,<br>
To visit beds of pain and death,<br>
Of restless limbs, and quivering breath,<br>
And sorrowing hearts, and patient eyes<br>
That see, through tears, the sun go down,<br>
But never more shall see it rise.<br>
The poor in body and estate,<br>
The sick and the disconsolate.<br>
Must not on man's convenience wait.<p></p>

This is the Black Pater-noster.<br>
God was my foster,<br>
He fostered me<br>
Under the book of the Palm-tree!<br>
St. Michael was my dame.<br>
He was born at Bethlehem,<br>
He was made of flesh and blood.<br>
God send me my right food,<br>
My right food, and shelter too,<br>
That I may to yon kirk go,<br>
To read upon yon sweet book<br>
Which the mighty God of heaven shook.<br>
Open, open, hell's gates!<br>
Shut, shut, heaven's gates!<br>
All the devils in the air<br>
The stronger be, that hear the Black Prayer!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Looking round the church</i>.)<br><p></p>

What a darksome and dismal place!<br>
I wonder that any man has the face<br>
To call such a hole the House of the Lord,<br>
And the Gate of Heaven,--yet such is the word.<br>
Ceiling, and walls, and windows old,<br>
Covered with cobwebs, blackened with mould;<br>
Dust on the pulpit, dust on the stairs,<br>
Dust on the benches, and stalls, and chairs!<br>
The pulpit, from which such ponderous sermons<br>
Have fallen down on the brains of the Germans,<br>
With about as much real edification<br>
As if a great Bible, bound in lead,<br>
Had fallen, and struck them on the head;<br>
And I ought to remember that sensation!<br>
Here stands the holy water stoup!<br>
Holy-water it may be to many,<br>
But to me, the veriest Liquor Gehennae!<br>
It smells like a filthy fast day soup!<br>
Near it stands the box for the poor;<br>
With its iron padlock, safe and sure,<br>
I and the priest of the parish know<br>
Whither all these charities go;<br>
Therefore, to keep up the institution,<br>
I will add my little contribution!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He puts in money.</i>)<br><p></p>

Underneath this mouldering tomb,<br>
With statue of stone, and scutcheon of brass,<br>
Slumbers a great lord of the village.<br>
All his life was riot and pillage,<br>
But at length, to escape the threatened doom<br>
Of the everlasting, penal fire,<br>
He died in the dress of a mendicant friar,<br>
And bartered his wealth for a daily mass.<br>
But all that afterward came to pass,<br>
And whether he finds it dull or pleasant,<br>
Is kept a secret for the present,<br>
At his own particular desire.<p></p>

And here, in a corner of the wall,<br>
Shadowy, silent, apart from all,<br>
With its awful portal open wide,<br>
And its latticed windows on either side,<br>
And its step well worn by the bended knees<br>
Of one or two pious centuries,<br>
Stands the village confessional!<br>
Within it, as an honored guest,<br>
I will sit me down awhile and rest!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Seats himself in the confessional</i>.)<br><p></p>

Here sits the priest, and faint and low,<br>
Like the sighing of an evening breeze,<br>
Comes through these painted lattices<br>
The ceaseless sound of human woe,<br>
Here, while her bosom aches and throbs<br>
With deep and agonizing sobs,<br>
That half are passion, half contrition,<br>
The luckless daughter of perdition<br>
Slowly confesses her secret shame!<br>
The time, the place, the lover's name!<br>
Here the grim murderer, with a groan,<br>
From his bruised conscience rolls the stone,<br>
Thinking that thus he can atone<br>
For ravages of sword and flame!<br>
Indeed, I marvel, and marvel greatly,<br>
How a priest can sit here so sedately,<br>
Reading, the whole year out and in,<br>
Naught but the catalogue of sin,<br>
And still keep any faith whatever<br>
In human virtue! Never! never!<p></p>

I cannot repeat a thousandth part<br>
Of the horrors and crimes and sins and woes<br>
That arise, when with palpitating throes<br>
The graveyard in the human heart<br>
Gives up its dead, at the voice of the priest,<br>
As if he were an archangel, at least.<br>
It makes a peculiar atmosphere,<br>
This odor of earthly passions and crimes,<br>
Such as I like to breathe, at times,<br>
And such as often brings me here<br>
In the hottest and most pestilential season.<br>
To-day, I come for another reason;<br>
To foster and ripen an evil thought<br>
In a heart that is almost to madness wrought,<br>
And to make a murderer out of a prince,<br>
A sleight of hand I learned long since!<br>
He comes  In the twilight he will not see<br>
the difference between his priest and me!<br>
In the same net was the mother caught!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Prince Henry entering and kneeling at the confessional.</i>)<br><p></p>

Remorseful, penitent, and lowly,<br>
I come to crave, O Father holy,<br>
Thy benediction on my head.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. The benediction shall be said<br>
After confession, not before!<br>
'T is a God speed to the parting guest,<br>
Who stands already at the door,<br>
Sandalled with holiness, and dressed<br>
In garments pure from earthly stain.<br>
Meanwhile, hast thou searched well thy breast?<br>
Does the same madness fill thy brain?<br>
Or have thy passion and unrest<br>
Vanished forever from thy mind?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. By the same madness still made blind,<br>
By the same passion still possessed,<br>
I come again to the house of prayer,<br>
A man afflicted and distressed!<br>
As in a cloudy atmosphere,<br>
Through unseen sluices of the air,<br>
A sudden and impetuous wind<br>
Strikes the great forest white with fear,<br>
And every branch, and bough, and spray<br>
Points all its quivering leaves one way,<br>
And meadows of grass, and fields of grain,<br>
And the clouds above, and the slanting rain,<br>
And smoke from chimneys of the town,<br>
Yield themselves to it, and bow down,<br>
So does this dreadful purpose press<br>
Onward, with irresistible stress,<br>
And all my thoughts and faculties,<br>
Struck level by the strength of this,<br>
From their true inclination turn,<br>
And all stream forward to Salem!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. Alas! we are but eddies of dust,<br>
Uplifted by the blast, and whirled<br>
Along the highway of the world<br>
A moment only, then to fall<br>
Back to a common level all,<br>
At the subsiding of the gust!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. O holy Father! pardon in me<br>
The oscillation of a mind<br>
Unsteadfast, and that cannot find<br>
Its centre of rest and harmony!<br>
For evermore before mine eyes<br>
This ghastly phantom flits and flies,<br>
And as a madman through a crowd,<br>
With frantic gestures and wild cries,<br>
It hurries onward, and aloud<br>
Repeats its awful prophecies!<br>
Weakness is wretchedness! To be strong<br>
Is to be happy! I am weak,<br>
And cannot find the good I seek,<br>
Because I feel and fear the wrong!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. Be not alarmed! The Church is kind--<br>
And in her mercy and her meekness<br>
She meets half-way her children's weakness,<br>
Writes their transgressions in the dust!<br>
Though in the Decalogue we find<br>
The mandate written, &quot;Thou shalt not kill!&quot;<br>
Yet there are cases when we must.<br>
In war, for instance, or from scathe<br>
To guard and keep the one true Faith!<br>
We must look at the Decalogue in the light<br>
Of an ancient statute, that was meant<br>
For a mild and general application,<br>
To be understood with the reservation,<br>
That, in certain instances, the Right<br>
Must yield to the Expedient!<br>
Thou art a Prince. If thou shouldst die,<br>
What hearts and hopes would prostrate he!<br>
What noble deeds, what fair renown,<br>
Into the grave with thee go down!<br>
What acts of valor and courtesy<br>
Remain undone, and die with thee!<br>
Thou art the last of all thy race!<br>
With thee a noble name expires,<br>
And vanishes from the earth's face<br>
The glorious memory of thy sires!<br>
She is a peasant. In her veins<br>
Flows common and plebeian blood;<br>
It is such as daily and hourly stains<br>
The dust and the turf of battle plains,<br>
By vassals shed, in a crimson flood,<br>
Without reserve, and without reward,<br>
At the slightest summons of their lord!<br>
But thine is precious, the fore-appointed<br>
Blood of kings, of God's anointed!<br>
Moreover, what has the world in store<br>
For one like her, but tears and toil?<br>
Daughter of sorrow, serf of the soil,<br>
A peasant's child and a peasant's wife,<br>
And her soul within her sick and sore<br>
With the roughness and barrenness of life!<br>
I marvel not at the heart's recoil<br>
From a fate like this, in one so tender,<br>
Nor at its eagerness to surrender<br>
All the wretchedness, want, and woe<br>
That await it in this world below,<br>
For the unutterable splendor<br>
Of the world of rest beyond the skies.<br>
So the Church sanctions the sacrifice:<br>
Therefore inhale this healing balm,<br>
And breathe this fresh life into thine;<br>
Accept the comfort and the calm<br>
She offers, as a gift divine,<br>
Let her fall down and anoint thy feet<br>
With the ointment costly and most sweet<br>
Of her young blood, and thou shall live.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> And will the righteous Heaven forgive?<br>
No action, whether foul or fair,<br>
Is ever done, but it leaves somewhere<br>
A record, written by fingers ghostly,<br>
As a blessing or a curse, and mostly<br>
In the greater weakness or greater strength<br>
Of the acts which follow it, till at length<br>
The wrongs of ages are redressed,<br>
And the justice of God made manifest!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient records it is stated<br>
That, whenever an evil deed is done,<br>
Another devil is created<br>
To scourge and torment the offending one!<br>
But evil is only good perverted,<br>
And Lucifer, the Bearer of Light,<br>
But an angel fallen and deserted,<br>
Thrust from his Father's house with a curse<br>
Into the black and endless night.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> If justice rules the universe,<br>
From the good actions of good men<br>
Angels of light should be begotten,<br>
And thus the balance restored again.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Yes; if the world were not so rotten,<br>
And so given over to the Devil!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> But this deed, is it good or evil?<br>
Have I thine absolution free<br>
To do it, and without restriction?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Ay; and from whatsoever sin<br>
Lieth around it and within,<br>
From all crimes in which it may involve thee,<br>
I now release thee and absolve thee!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Give me thy holy benediction.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> (<i>stretching forth his hand and muttering</i>),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maledictione perpetua<br>

And in every deed!<br>
Let not the illusion of thy senses<br>
Betray thee to deadly offences.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb</i>. It is decided! For many days,<br>

A nameless terror in our breast,<br>
Making us timid, and afraid<br>
Of God, and his mysterious ways!<br>
We have been sorrowful and sad;<br>
Much have we suffered, much have prayed<br>
That he would lead us as is best,<br>
And show us what his will required.<br>
It is decided; and we give<br>
Our child, O Prince, that you may live!<p></p>

He takes her to himself again.<br>

With the Angel of the Lord in vain<br>
It wrestled, for he was the stronger.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gottlieb</i>. As Abraham offered long ago<br>
His son unto the Lord, and even<br>
The Everlasting Father in heaven<br>
Gave his, as a lamb unto the slaughter,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Promise me,<br>
When we are gone from here, and on our way<br>
Are journeying to Salerno, you will not,<br>
By word or deed, endeavor to dissuade me<br>
And turn me from my purpose, but remember<br>
That as a pilgrim to the Holy City<br>
Walks unmolested, and with thoughts of pardon<br>
Occupied wholly, so would I approach<br>
The gates of Heaven, in this great jubilee,<br>
With my petition, putting off from me<br>
All thoughts of earth, as shoes from off my feet.<br>
Promise me this.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Thy words fall from thy lips<br>
Like roses from the lips of Angelo: and angels<br>
Might stoop to pick them up!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you not promise?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever we depart upon this journey,<br>
So long to one or both of us, I promise.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we not go, then? Have you lifted me<br>
Into the air, only to hurl me back<br>
Wounded upon the ground? and offered me<br>
The waters of eternal life, to bid me<br>
Drink the polluted puddles of this world?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;O Elsie! what a lesson thou dost teach me!<br>
The life which is, and that which is to come,<br>
Suspended hang in such nice equipoise<br>
A breath disturbs the balance; and that scale<br>
In which we throw our hearts preponderates,<br>
And the other, like an empty one, flies up,<br>
And is accounted vanity and air!<br>
To me the thought of death is terrible,<br>
Having such hold on life. To thee it is not<br>
So much even as the lifting of a latch;<br>
Only a step into the open air<br>
Out of a tent already luminous<br>
With light that shines through its transparent walls!<br>
O pure in heart! from thy sweet dust shall grow<br>
Lilies, upon whose petals will be written<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake not, beloved! be thy sleep<br>
Silent as night is, and as deep!<br>
There walks a sentinel at thy gate<br>
Whose heart is heavy and desolate,<br>
And the heavings of whose bosom number<br>
The respirations of thy slumber,<br>
As if some strange, mysterious fate<br>
Had linked two hearts in one, and mine<br>
Went madly wheeling about thine,<br>
Only with wider and wilder sweep!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Crier of the dead (at a distance).</i> Wake! wake!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ye that sleep!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray for the Dead!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Lo! with what depth of blackness thrown<br>
Against the clouds, far up the skies,<br>
The walls of the cathedral rise,<br>
Like a mysterious grove of stone,<br>
With fitful lights and shadows bleeding,<br>
As from behind, the moon, ascending,<br>
Lights its dim aisles and paths unknown!<br>
The wind is rising; but the boughs<br>
Rise not and fall not with the wind<br>
That through their foliage sobs and soughs;<br>
Only the cloudy rack behind,<br>
Drifting onward, wild and ragged,<br>
Gives to each spire and buttress jagged<br>
A seeming motion undefined.<br>
Below on the square, an armed knight,<br>
Still as a statue and as white,<br>
Sits on his steed, and the moonbeams quiver<br>
Upon the points of his armor bright<br>
As on the ripples of a river.<br>
He lifts the visor from his cheek,<br>
And beckons, and makes as he would speak.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter the Minnesinger</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend! can you tell me where alight<br>
Thuringia's horsemen for the night?<br>
For I have lingered in the rear,<br>
And wander vainly up and down.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a stranger in the town,<br>
As thou art, but the voice I hear<br>
Is not a stranger to mine ear.<br>
Thou art Walter of the Vogelweid!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast guessed rightly; and thy name<br>
Is Henry of Hoheneck!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> Ay, the same.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter</i> (<i>embracing him</i>). Come closer, closer to my side!<br>
What brings thee hither? What potent charm<br>
Has drawn thee from thy German farm<br>
Into the old Alsatian city?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. A tale of wonder and of pity!<br>
A wretched man, almost by stealth<br>
Dragging my body to Salern,<br>
In the vain hope and search for health,<br>
And destined never to return.<br>
Already thou hast heard the rest<br>
But what brings thee, thus armed and dight<br>
In the equipments of a knight?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter</i>. Dost thou not see upon my breast<br>
The cross of the Crusaders shine?<br>
My pathway leads to Palestine.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. Ah, would that way were also mine!<br>
O noble poet! thou whose heart<br>
Is like a nest of singing birds<br>
Rocked on the topmost bough of life,<br>
Wilt thou, too, from our sky depart,<br>
And in the clangor of the strife<br>
Mingle the music of thy words?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter</i>. My hopes are high, my heart is proud,<br>
And like a trumpet long and loud,<br>
Thither my thoughts all clang and ring!<br>
My life is in my hand, and lo!<br>
I grasp and bend it as a bow,<br>
And shoot forth from its trembling string<br>
An arrow, that shall be, perchance,<br>
Like the arrow of the Israelite king<br>
Shot from the window toward the east,<br>
That of the Lord's deliverance!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. My life, alas! is what thou seest!<br>
O enviable fate! to be<br>
Strong, beautiful, and armed like thee<br>
With lyre and sword, with song and steel;<br>
A hand to smite, a heart to feel!<br>
Thy heart, thy hand, thy lyre, thy sword,<br>
Thou givest all unto thy Lord,<br>
While I, so mean and abject grown,<br>
Am thinking of myself alone.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter</i>. Be patient: Time will reinstate<br>
Thy health and fortunes.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. 'T is too late!<br>
I cannot strive against my fate!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter</i>. Come with me; for my steed is weary;<br>
Our journey has been long and dreary,<br>
And, dreaming of his stall, he dints<br>
With his impatient hoofs the flints.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> (<i>aside</i>). I am ashamed, in my disgrace,<br>
To look into that noble face!<br>
To-morrow, Walter, let it be.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walter</i>. To-morrow, at the dawn of day,<br>
I shall again be on my way<br>
Come with me to the hostelry,<br>
For I have many things to say.<br>
Our journey into Italy<br>
Perchance together we may make;<br>
Wilt thou not do it for my sake?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. A sick man's pace would but impede<br>
Thine eager and impatient speed.<br>
Besides, my pathway leads me round<br>
To Hirsehau, in the forest's bound,<br>
Where I assemble man and steed,<br>
And all things for my journey's need.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>They go out</i>. LUCIFER, <i>flying over the city</i>.)<br><p></p>

Sleep, sleep, O city! till the light<br>
Wakes you to sin and crime again,<br>
Whilst on your dreams, like dismal rain,<br>
I scatter downward through the night<br>
My maledictions dark and deep.<br>
I have more martyrs in your walls<br>
Than God has; and they cannot sleep;<br>
They are my bondsmen and my thralls;<br>
Their wretched lives are full of pain,<br>
Wild agonies of nerve and brain;<br>
And every heart-beat, every breath,<br>
Is a convulsion worse than death!<br>
Sleep, sleep, O city! though within<br>
The circuit of your walls there lies<br>
No habitation free from sin,<br>
And all its nameless miseries;<br>
The aching heart, the aching head,<br>
Grief for the living and the dead,<br>
And foul corruption of the time,<br>
Disease, distress, and want, and woe,<br>
And crimes, and passions that may grow<br>
Until they ripen into, crime!<p></p>

<H2>SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL.</H2>

<i>Easter Sunday</i>. FRIAR CUTHBERT <i>preaching to the
crowd from a pulpit in the open air</i>. PRINCE
HENRY <i>and</i> ELSIE <i>crossing the square</i>.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. This is the day, when from the dead<br>
Our Lord arose; and everywhere,<br>
Out of their darkness and despair,<br>
Triumphant over fears and foes,<br>
The hearts of his disciples rose,<br>
When to the women, standing near,<br>
The Angel in shining vesture said,<br>
&quot;The Lord is risen; he is not here!&quot;<br>
And, mindful that the day is come,<br>
On all the hearths in Christendom<br>
The fires are quenched, to be again<br>
Rekindled from the sun, that high<br>
Is dancing in the cloudless sky.<br>
The churches are all decked with flowers.<br>
The salutations among men<br>
Are but the Angel's words divine,<br>
&quot;Christ is arisen!&quot; and the bells<br>
Catch the glad murmur, as it swells,<br>
And chaunt together in their towers.<br>
All hearts are glad; and free from care<br>
The faces of the people shine.<br>
See what a crowd is in the square,<br>
Gaily and gallantly arrayed!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i>. Let us go back; I am afraid!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. Nay, let us mount the church-steps here,<br>
Under the doorway's sacred shadow;<br>
We can see all things, and be freer<br>
From the crowd that madly heaves and presses!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> What a gay pageant! what bright dresses!<br>
It looks like a flower besprinkled meadow.<br>
What is that yonder on the square?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> A pulpit in the open air,<br>
And a Friar, who is preaching to the crowd<br>
With a voice so deep and clear and loud,<br>
That, if we listen, and give heed,<br>
His lowest words will reach the ear.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert (gesticulating and cracking a postilion's whip)</i> What ho! good people! do you not hear?<br>
Dashing along at the top of his speed,<br>
Booted and spurred, on his jaded steed,<br>
A courier comes with words of cheer.<br>
Courier! what is the news, I pray?<br>
&quot;Christ is arisen!&quot; Whence come you? &quot;From court.&quot;<br>
Then I do not believe it; you say it in sport.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Cracks his whip again.</i>)<br><p></p>

There comes another, riding this way;<br>
We soon shall know what he has to say.<br>
Courier! what are the tidings to-day?<br>
&quot;Christ is arisen!&quot; Whence come you? &quot;From town.&quot;<br>
Then I do not believe it; away with you, clown.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Cracks his whip more violently.</i>)<br><p></p>

And here comes a third, who is spurring amain;<br>
What news do you bring, with your loose-hanging rein,<br>
Your spurs wet with blood, and your bridle with foam?<br>
&quot;Christ is arisen!&quot; Whence come you? &quot;From Rome.&quot;<br>
Ah, now I believe. He is risen, indeed.<br>
Ride on with the news, at the top of your speed!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Great applause among the crowd.</i>)<br><p></p>

To come back to my text! When the news was first spread<br>
That Christ was arisen indeed from the dead,<br>
Very great was the joy of the angels in heaven;<br>
And as great the dispute as to who should carry<br>
The tidings, thereof to the Virgin Mary,<br>
Pierced to the heart with sorrows seven.<br>
Old Father Adam was first to propose,<br>
As being the author of all our woes;<br>
But he was refused, for fear, said they,<br>
He would stop to eat apples on the way!<br>
Abel came next, but petitioned in vain,<br>
Because he might meet with his brother Cain!<br>
Noah, too, was refused, lest his weakness for wine<br>
Should delay him at every tavern sign;<br>
And John the Baptist could not get a vote,<br>
On account of his old fashioned, camel's-hair coat;<br>
And the Penitent Thief, who died on the cross,<br>
Was reminded that all his bones were broken!<br>
Till at last, when each in turn had spoken,<br>
The company being still at a loss,<br>
The Angel, who had rolled away the stone,<br>
Was sent to the sepulchre, all alone,<br>
And filled with glory that gloomy prison,<br>
And said to the Virgin, &quot;The Lord is arisen!&quot;<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>The Cathedral bells ring</i>.)<br><p></p>

But hark! the bells are beginning to chime;<br>
And I feel that I am growing hoarse.<br>
I will put an end to my discourse,<br>
And leave the rest for some other time.<br>
For the bells themselves are the best of preachers;<br>
Their brazen lips are learned teachers,<br>
From their pulpits of stone, in the upper air,<br>
Sounding aloft, without crack or flaw,<br>
Shriller than trumpets under the Law,<br>
Now a sermon and now a prayer.<br>
The clangorous hammer is the tongue,<br>
This way, that way, beaten and swung,<br>
That from mouth of brass, as from Mouth of Gold,<br>
May be taught the Testaments, New and Old.<br>
And above it the great crossbeam of wood<br>
Representeth the Holy Rood,<br>
Upon which, like the bell, our hopes are hung.<br>
And the wheel wherewith it is swayed and rung<br>
Is the mind of man, that round and round<br>
Sways, and maketh the tongue to sound!<br>
And the rope, with its twisted cordage three,<br>
Denoteth the Scriptural Trinity<br>
Of Morals, and Symbols, and History;<br>
And the upward and downward motions show<br>
That we touch upon matters high and low;<br>
And the constant change and transmutation<br>
Of action and of contemplation,<br>
Downward, the Scripture brought from on high,<br>
Upward, exalted again to the sky;<br>
Downward, the literal interpretation,<br>
Upward, the Vision and Mystery!<p></p>

And now, my hearers, to make an end,<br>
I have only one word more to say;<br>
In the church, in honor of Easter day,<br>
Will be represented a Miracle Play;<br>
And I hope you will all have the grace to attend.<br>
Christ bring us at last So his felicity!<br>
Pax vobiscum! et Benedicite!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> I am at home here in my Father's house!<br>
These paintings of the Saints upon the walls<br>
Have all familiar and benignant faces.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> The portraits of the family of God!<br>
Thine own hereafter shall be placed among them.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> How very grand it is and wonderful!<br>
Never have I beheld a church so splendid!<br>
Such columns, and such arches, and such windows,<br>
So many tombs and statues in the chapels,<br>
And under them so many confessionals.<br>
They must be for the rich. I should not like<br>
To tell my sins in such a church as this.<br>
Who built it?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;A great master of his craft,<br>
Erwin von Steinbach; but not he alone,<br>
For many generations labored with him.<br>
Children that came to see these Saints in stone,<br>
As day by day out of the blocks they rose,<br>
Grew old and died, and still the work went on,<br>
And on, and on, and is not yet completed.<br>
The generation that succeeds our own<br>
Perhaps may finish it. The architect<br>
Built his great heart into these sculptured stones,<br>
And with him toiled his children, and their lives<br>
Were builded, with his own, into the walls,<br>
As offerings unto God. You see that statue<br>
Fixing its joyous, but deep-wrinkled eyes<br>
Upon the Pillar of the Angels yonder.<br>
That is the image of the master, carved<br>
By the fair hand of his own child, Sabina.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> How beautiful is the column that he looks at!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> That, too, she sculptured. At the base of it<br>
Stand the Evangelists; above their heads<br>
Four Angels blowing upon marble trumpets,<br>
And over them the blessed Christ, surrounded<br>
By his attendant ministers, upholding<br>
The instruments of his passion.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> O my Lord!<br>
Would I could leave behind me upon earth<br>
Some monument to thy glory, such as this!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> A greater monument than this thou leavest<br>
In thine own life, all purity and love!<br>
See, too, the Rose, above the western portal<br>
Flamboyant with a thousand gorgeous colors,<br>
The perfect flower of Gothic loveliness!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> And, in the gallery, the long line of statues,<br>
Christ with his twelve Apostles watching us.<p></p>

his train.</i>)<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> But come away; we have not time to look.<br>
The crowd already fills the church, and yonder<br>
Upon a stage, a herald with a trumpet,<br>
Clad like The Angel Gabriel, proclaims<br>
The Mystery that will now be represented.<p></p>

Of the forbidden fruit he ate,<br>

Though humbly born in Bethlehem,<br>
A sceptre and a diadem<br>

The sceptre is a simple reed,<br>
The crown will make thy temples bleed,<br>
And in thy hour of greatest need,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Belshazzar</i>. Hail to thee, Christ of Christendom!<br>
O'er all the earth thy kingdom come!<br>
From distant Trebizond to Rome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy name shall men adore!<br>
Peace and good-will among all men,<br>
The Virgin has returned again,<br>
Returned the old Saturnian reign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Golden Age once more.<p></p>

Born here to suffer and to die<br>
According to the prophecy,<br>

And keep them precious, for his sake;<br>
For benediction thus we make,<br>

<p>V.  THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT.</p>
<br>

<i>Here shall</i> JOSEPH <i>come in, leading an ass, on which
are seated</i> MARY <i>and the</i> CHILD.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mary</i>. Here will we rest us, under these<br>
Underhanging branches of the trees,<br>
Where robins chant their Litanies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And canticles of joy.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Joseph</i>. My saddle-girths have given way<br>
With trudging through the heat to-day<br>
To you I think it is but play<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To ride and hold the boy.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mary</i>. Hark! how the robins shout and sing,<br>
As if to hail their infant King!<br>
I will alight at yonder spring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wash his little coat.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Joseph</i>. And I will hobble well the ass,<br>
Lest, being loose upon the grass,<br>
He should escape; for, by the mass.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He is nimble as a goat.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Here</i> MARY <i>shall alight and go to the spring.</i>)<br><p></p>

For men are sleeping in the shade;<br>
I fear that we shall be waylaid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And robbed and beaten sore!<p></p>

Of wealth I have no store.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dumachus</i>. Give up your money!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Titus</i>. Prithee cease!<br>
Let these good people go in peace!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dumachus</i>. First let them pay for their release,<br>
And then go on their way.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Titus</i>. These forty groats I give in fee,<br>
If thou wilt only silent be.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mary</i>. May God be merciful to thee<br>
Upon the Judgment Day!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jesus</i>. When thirty years shall have gone by,<br>
I at Jerusalem shall die,<br>
By Jewish hands exalted high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the accursed tree.<br>
Then on my right and my left side,<br>
These thieves shall both be crucified<br>
And Titus thenceforth shall abide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In paradise with me.<p></p>

<p>VI.  THE SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>King Herod.</i> Potz-tausend! Himmel-sacrament!<br>
Filled am I with great wonderment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At this unwelcome news!<br>
Am I not Herod? Who shall dare<br>
My crown to take, my sceptre bear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As king among the Jews?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Here he shall stride up and down and flourish his sword.</i>)<br><p></p>

What ho! I fain would drink a can<br>
Of the strong wine of Canaan!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine of Helbon bring,<br>
I purchased at the Fair of Tyre,<br>
As red as blood, as hot as fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fit for any king!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He quaffs great goblets of wine.</i>)<br><p></p>

Now at the window will I stand,<br>
While in the street the armed band<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The little children slay:<br>
The babe just born in Bethlehem<br>
Will surely slaughtered be with them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor live another day!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Here a voice of lamentation shall be heard in the street.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Herod.</i> Ho seneschal! another cup!<br>
With wine of Sorek fill it up!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would a bumper drain!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rahab.</i> May maledictions fall and blast<br>
Thyself and lineage, to the last<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all thy kith and kin!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Herod.</i> Another goblet! quick! and stir<br>
Pomegranate juice and drops of myrrh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And calamus therein!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Soldiers (in the street)</i>. Give up thy child into our hands!<br>
It is King Herod who commands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he should thus be slain!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Nurse Medusa.</i> O monstrous men! What have ye done!<br>
It is King Herod's only son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ye have cleft in twain!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Herod.</i> Ah, luckless day! What words of fear<br>
Are these that smite upon my ear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a doleful sound!<br>
What torments rack my heart and head!<br>
Would I were dead! would I were dead,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jesus.</i> The shower is over. Let us play,<br>
And make some sparrows out of clay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down by the river's side.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Judas.</i> See, how the stream has overflowed<br>
Its banks, and o'er the meadow road<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is spreading far and wide!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>They draw water out of the river by channels, and
form little pools</i> JESUS <i>makes twelve sparrows of
clay, and the other boys do the same.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jesus.</i> Look! look! how prettily I make<br>
These little sparrows by the lake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bend down their necks and drink!<br>
Now will I make them sing and soar<br>
So far, they shall return no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into this river's brink.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Judas.</i> That canst thou not! They are but clay,<br>
They cannot sing, nor fly away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the meadow lands!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jesus.</i> Fly, fly! ye sparrows! you are free!<br>
And while you live, remember me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who made you with my hands.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Here</i> JESUS <i>shall clap his hands, and the sparrows
 shall fly away, chirruping.</i>)<br><p></p>

Oft has my mother told me so,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not play with thee!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He strikes</i> JESUS <i>on the right side.</i>)<br><p></p>

And when I shall be crucified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall I pierced be!<p></p>

And break the holy Sabbath day?<br>
What, think ye, will your mothers say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see you in such plight!<br>
In such a sweat and such a heat,<br>
With all that mud-upon your feet!<br>

<i>The</i> RABBI BEN ISRAEL, <i>with a long beard, sitting on
 a high stool, with a rod in his hand.</i><br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rabbi.</i> I am the Rabbi Ben Israel,<br>
Throughout this village known full well,<br>
And, as my scholars all will tell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned in things divine;<br>
The Kabala and Talmud hoar<br>
Than all the prophets prize I more,<br>
For water is all Bible lore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mishna is strong wine.<p></p>

My fame extends from West to East,<br>
And always, at the Purim feast,<br>
I am as drunk as any beast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That wallows in his sty;<br>
The wine it so elateth me,<br>
That I no difference can see<br>
Between &quot;Accursed Haman be!&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And &quot;Blessed be Mordecai!&quot;<p></p>

Come hither, Judas Iscariot.<br>
Say, if thy lesson thou hast got<br>
From the Rabbinical Book or not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why howl the dogs at night?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Judas.</i> In the Rabbinical Book, it saith<br>
The dogs howl, when with icy breath<br>
Great Samma&euml;l, the Angel of Death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes through the town his flight!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rabbi.</i> Well, boy! now say, if thou art wise,<br>
When the Angel of Death, who is full of eyes,<br>
Comes where a sick man dying lies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What doth he to the wight?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Judas.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;He stands beside him, dark and tall,<br>
Holding a sword, from which doth fall<br>
Into his mouth a drop of gall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so he turneth white.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rabbi.</i> And now, my Judas, say to me<br>
What the great Voices Four may be,<br>
That quite across the world do flee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And are not heard by men?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Judas.</i> The Voice of the Sun in heaven's dome,<br>
The Voice of the Murmuring of Rome,<br>
The Voice of a Soul that goeth home,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Angel of the Rain!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rabbi.</i> Well have ye answered every one<br>
Now little Jesus, the carpenter's son,<br>
Let us see how thy task is done.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Canst thou thy letters say?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jesus.</i> Aleph.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rabbi.</i> What next? Do not stop yet!<br>
Go on with all the alphabet.<br>
Come, Aleph, Beth; dost thou forget?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cock's soul! thou'dst rather play!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jesus.</i> What Aleph means I fain would know,<br>
Before I any farther go!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rabbi.</i> O, by Saint Peter! wouldst thou so?<br>
Come hither, boy, to me.<br>
And surely as the letter Jod<br>
Once cried aloud, and spake to God,<br>
So surely shalt thou feel this rod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And punished shalt thou be!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Here</i> RABBI BEN ISRAEL <i>shall lift up his rod to strike</i> JESUS, <i>and his right arm shall be paralyzed.</i>)<br><p></p>

JESUS <i>sitting among his playmates, crowned with
flowers as their King.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Boys.</i> We spread our garments on the ground'<br>
With fragrant flowers thy head is crowned,<br>
While like a guard we stand around,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hail thee as our King!<br>
Thou art the new King of the Jews!<br>
Nor let the passers-by refuse<br>
To bring that homage which men use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To majesty to bring.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Boys.</i> Come hither! and all reverence pay<br>
Unto our monarch, crowned to-day!<br>
Then go rejoicing on your way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all prosperity!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Traveller.</i> Hail to the King of Bethlehem,<br>
Who weareth in his diadem<br>
The yellow crocus for the gem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his authority!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He passes by; and others come in, bearing on a litter a sick child.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Boys.</i> Set down the litter and draw near!<br>
The King of Bethlehem is here!<br>
What ails the child, who seems to fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That we shall do him harm?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Bearers.</i> He climbed up to the robin's nest,<br>
And out there darted, from his rest,<br>
A serpent with a crimson crest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stung him in the arm.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jesus.</i> Bring him to me, and let me feel<br>
The wounded place; my touch can heal<br>
The sting of serpents, and can steal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The poison from the bite!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He touches the wound, and the boy begins to cry.</i>)<br><p></p>

Cease to lament! I can foresee<br>
That thou hereafter known shalt be,<br>
Among the men who follow me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Simon the Canaanite!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><p></p>

In the after part of the day<br>
Will be represented another play,<br>
Of the Passion of our Blessed Lord,<br>
Beginning directly after Nones!<br>
At the close of which we shall accord,<br>
By way of benison and reward,<br>
The sight of a holy Martyr's bones!<p></p>

<H2> THE ROAD HIRSCHAU.</H2>

<hr style="width: 35%;">

PRINCE HENRY <i>and</i> ELSIE, <i>with their attendants, on
horseback.</i><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Onward and onward the highway runs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the distant city, impatiently bearing<br>
Tidings of human joy and disaster, of love and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hate, of doing and daring!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;This life of ours is a wild aeolian<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harp of many a joyous strain,<br>
But under them all there runs a loud perpetual wail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as of souls in pain.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Faith alone can interpret life, and the heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that aches and bleeds with the stigma<br>
Of pain, alone bears the likeness of Christ, and can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comprehend its dark enigma.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Man is selfish, and seeketh pleasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with little care of what may betide;<br>
Else why am I travelling here beside thee, a demon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that rides by an angel's side?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> All the hedges are white with dust, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the great dog under the creaking wain<br>
Hangs his head in the lazy heat, while onward the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; horses toil and strain<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Now they stop at the wayside inn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the wagoner laughs with the landlord's daughter,<br>
While out of the dripping trough the horses distend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their leathern sides with water.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> All through life there are wayside inns,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where man may refresh his soul with love;<br>
Even the lowest may quench his thirst at rivulets fed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by springs from above.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Yonder, where rises the cross of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone, our journey along the highway ends,<br>
And over the fields, by a bridle path, down into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broad green valley descends.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> I am not sorry to leave behind the beaten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; road with its dust and heat;<br>
The air will be sweeter far, and the turf will be softer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under our horses' feet.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>They turn down a green lane.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Sweet is the air with the budding haws,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the valley stretching for miles below<br>
Is white with blossoming cheery trees, as if just covered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with lightest snow.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Over our heads a white cascade is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gleaming against the distant hill;<br>
We cannot hear it, nor see it move, but it hangs like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a banner when winds are still.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Damp and cool is this deep ravine, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cool the sound of the brook by our side!<br>
What is this castle that rises above us, and lords it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over a land so wide?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> It is the home of the Counts of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calva; well have I known these scenes of old,<br>
Well I remember each tower and turret, remember the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brooklet, the wood, and the wold.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Hark! from the little village below us the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bells of the church are ringing for rain!<br>
Priests and peasants in long procession come forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and kneel on the arid plain.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> They have not long to wait, for I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see in the south uprising a little cloud,<br>
That before the sun shall be set will cover the sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above us as with a shroud.<br><p></p>

<h2>THE CONVENT OF HIRSCHAU IN THE
BLACK FOREST.</H2>

<hr style="width: 25%;">

<i>The Convent cellar.</i> FRIAR CLAUS <i>comes in with a
light and a basket of empty flagons.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Claus.</i> I always enter this sacred place<br>
With a thoughtful, solemn, and reverent pace,<br>
Pausing long enough on each stair<br>
To breathe an ejaculatory prayer,<br>
And a benediction on the vines<br>
That produce these various sorts of wines!<p></p>

For my part, I am well content<br>
That we have got through with the tedious Lent!<br>
Fasting is all very well for those<br>
Who have to contend with invisible foes;<br>
But I am quite sure it does not agree<br>
With a quiet, peaceable man like me,<br>
Who am not of that nervous and meagre kind<br>
That are always distressed in body and mind!<br>
And at times it really does me good<br>
To come down among this brotherhood,<br>
Dwelling forever under ground,<br>
Silent, contemplative, round and sound;<br>
Each one old, and brown with mould,<br>
But filled to the lips with the ardor of youth,<br>
With the latent power and love of truth,<br>
And with virtues fervent and manifold.<p></p>

I have heard it said, that at Easter-tide,<br>
When buds are swelling on every side,<br>
And the sap begins to move in the vine.<br>
Then in all the cellars, far and wide,<br>
The oldest, as well as the newest, wine<br>
Begins to stir itself, and ferment,<br>
With a kind of revolt and discontent<br>
At being so long in darkness pent,<br>
And fain would burst from its sombre tun<br>
To bask on the hillside in the sun;<br>
As in the bosom of us poor friars,<br>
The tumult of half-subdued desires<br>
For the world that we have left behind<br>
Disturbs at times all peace of mind!<br>
And now that we have lived through Lent,<br>
My duty it is, as often before,<br>
To open awhile the prison-door,<br>
And give these restless spirits vent.<p></p>

Now here is a cask that stands alone,<br>
And has stood a hundred years or more,<br>
Its beard of cobwebs, long and hoar,<br>
Trailing and sweeping along the floor,<br>
Like Barbarossa, who sits in his cave,<br>
Taciturn, sombre, sedate, and grave,<br>
Till his beard has grown through the table of stone!<br>
It is of the quick and not of the dead!<br>
In its veins the blood is hot and red,<br>
And a heart still beats in those ribs of oak<br>
That time may have tamed, but has not broke;<br>
It comes from Bacharach on the Rhine,<br>
Is one of the three best kinds of wine,<br>
And costs some hundred florins the ohm;<br>
But that I do not consider dear,<br>
When I remember that every year<br>
Four butts are sent to the Pope of Rome.<br>
And whenever a goblet thereof I drain,<br>
The old rhyme keeps running in my brain:<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Bacharach on the Rhine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Hochheim on the Main,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at W&uuml;rzburg on the Stein,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grow the three best kinds of wine!<br><p></p>

They are all good wines, and better far<br>
Than those of the Neckar, or those of the Ahr<br>
In particular, W&uuml;rzburg well may boast<br>
Of its blessed wine of the Holy Ghost,<br>
Which of all wines I like the most.<br>
This I shall draw for the Abbot's drinking,<br>
Who seems to be much of my way of thinking.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Fills a flagon.</i>)<br><p></p>

Ah! how the streamlet laughs and sings!<br>
What a delicious fragrance springs<br>
From the deep flagon, while it fills,<br>
As of hyacinths and daffodils!<br>
Between this cask and the Abbot's lips<br>
Many have been the sips and slips;<br>
Many have been the draughts of wine,<br>
On their way to his, that have stopped at mine;<br>
And many a time my soul has hankered<br>
For a deep draught out of his silver tankard,<br>
When it should have been busy with other affairs,<br>
Less with its longings and more with its prayers.<br>
But now there is no such awkward condition,<br>
No danger of death and eternal perdition;<br>
So here's to the Abbot and Brothers all,<br>
Who dwell in this convent of Peter and Paul!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He drinks.</i>)<br<p>></p>

O cordial delicious! O soother of pain!<br>
It flashes like sunshine into my brain!<br>
A benison rest on the Bishop who sends<br>
Such a fudder of wine as this to his friends!<p></p>

And now a flagon for such as may ask<br>
A draught from the noble Bacharach cask,<br>
And I will be gone, though I know full well<br>
The cellar's a cheerfuller place than the cell.<br>
Behold where he stands, all sound and good,<br>
Brown and old in his oaken hood;<br>
Silent he seems externally<br>
As any Carthusian monk may be;<br>
But within, what a spirit of deep unrest!<br>
What a seething and simmering in his breast!<br>
As if the heaving of his great heart<br>
Would burst his belt of oak apart!<br>
Let me unloose this button of wood,<br>
And quiet a little his turbulent mood.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Sets it running.</i>)<br><p></p>

See! how its currents gleam and shine,<br>
As if they had caught the purple hues<br>
Of autumn sunsets on the Rhine,<br>
Descending and mingling with the dews;<br>
Or as if the grapes were stained with the blood<br>
Of the innocent boy, who, some years back,<br>
Was taken and crucified by the Jews,<br>
In that ancient town of Bacharach;<br>
Perdition upon those infidel Jews,<br>
In that ancient town of Bacharach!<br>
The beautiful town, that gives us wine<br>
With the fragrant odor of Muscadine!<br>
I should deem it wrong to let this pass<br>
Without first touching my lips to the glass,<br>
For here in the midst of the current I stand,<br>
Like the stone Pfalz in the midst of the river<br>
Taking toll upon either hand,<br>
And much more grateful to the giver.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He drinks.</i>)<br><p></p>

Here, now, is a very inferior kind,<br>
Such as in any town you may find,<br>
Such as one might imagine would suit<br>
The rascal who drank wine out of a boot,<br>
And, after all, it was not a crime,<br>
For he won thereby Dorf H&uuml;ffelsheim.<br>
A jolly old toper! who at a pull<br>
Could drink a postilion's jack boot full,<br>
And ask with a laugh, when that was done,<br>
If the fellow had left the other one!<br>
This wine is as good as we can afford<br>
To the friars, who sit at the lower board,<br>
And cannot distinguish bad from good,<br>
And are far better off than if they could,<br>
Being rather the rude disciples of beer<br>
Than of anything more refined and dear!<p></p>

FRIAR PACIFICUS <i>transcribing and illuminating.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Pacificus</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is growing dark! Yet one line more,<br>
And then my work for today is o'er.<br>
I come again to the name of the Lord!<br>
Ere I that awful name record,<br>
That is spoken so lightly among men,<br>
Let me pause awhile, and wash my pen;<br>
Pure from blemish and blot must it be<br>
When it writes that word of mystery!<p></p>

Thus have I labored on and on,<br>
Nearly through the Gospel of John.<br>
Can it be that from the lips<br>
Of this same gentle Evangelist,<br>
That Christ himself perhaps has kissed,<br>
Came the dread Apocalypse!<br>
It has a very awful look,<br>
As it stands there at the end of the book,<br>
Like the sun in an eclipse.<br>
Ah me! when I think of that vision divine,<br>
Think of writing it, line by line,<br>
I stand in awe of the terrible curse,<br>
Like the trump of doom, in the closing verse!<br>
God forgive me! if ever I<br>
Take aught from the book of that Prophecy,<br>
Lest my part too should be taken away<br>
From the Book of Life on the Judgment Day.<p></p>

This is well written, though I say it!<br>
I should not be afraid to display it,<br>
In open day, on the selfsame shelf<br>
With the writings of St Thecla herself,<br>
Or of Theodosius, who of old<br>
Wrote the Gospels in letters of gold!<br>
That goodly folio standing yonder,<br>
Without a single blot or blunder,<br>
Would not bear away the palm from mine,<br>
If we should compare them line for line.<p></p>

There, now, is an initial letter!<br>
King Ren&eacute; himself never made a better!<br>
Finished down to the leaf and the snail,<br>
Down to the eyes on the peacock's tail!<br>
And now, as I turn the volume over,<br>
And see what lies between cover and cover,<br>
What treasures of art these pages hold,<br>
All ablaze with crimson and gold,<br>
God forgive me! I seem to feel<br>
A certain satisfaction steal<br>
Into my heart, and into my brain,<br>
As if my talent had not lain<br>
Wrapped in a napkin, and all in vain.<br>
Yes, I might almost say to the Lord,<br>
Here is a copy of thy Word,<br>
Written out with much toil and pain;<br>
Take it, O Lord, and let it be<br>
As something I have done for thee!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He looks from the window.</i>)<br><p></p>

How sweet the air is! How fair the scene!<br>
I wish I had as lovely a green<br>
To paint my landscapes and my leaves!<br>
How the swallows twitter under the eaves!<br>
There, now, there is one in her nest;<br>
I can just catch a glimpse of her head and breast,<br>
And will sketch her thus, in her quiet nook,<br>
In the margin of my Gospel book.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He makes a sketch.</i>)<br><p></p>

I can see no more. Through the valley yonder<br>
A shower is passing; I hear the thunder<br>
Mutter its curses in the air,<br>
The Devil's own and only prayer!<br>
The dusty road is brown with rain,<br>
And speeding on with might and main,<br>
Hitherward rides a gallant train.<br>
They do not parley, they cannot wait,<br>
But hurry in at the convent gate.<br>
What a fair lady! and beside her<br>
What a handsome, graceful, noble rider!<br>
Now she gives him her hand to alight;<br>
They will beg a shelter for the night.<br>
I will go down to the corridor,<br>
And try to see that face once more;<br>
It will do for the face of some beautiful Saint,<br>
Or for one of the Maries I shall paint.<p></p>

<i>The</i> ABBOT ERNESTUS <i>pacing to and fro.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> Slowly, slowly up the wall<br>
Steals the sunshine, steals the shade;<br>
Evening damps begin to fall,<br>
Evening shadows are displayed.<br>
Round me, o'er me, everywhere,<br>
All the sky is grand with clouds,<br>
And athwart the evening air<br>
Wheel the swallows home in crowds.<br>
Shafts of sunshine from the west<br>
Paint the dusky windows red;<br>
Darker shadows, deeper rest,<br>
Underneath and overhead.<br>
Darker, darker, and more wan,<br>
In my breast the shadows fall;<br>
Upward steals the life of man,<br>
As the sunshine from the wall.<br>
From the wall into the sky,<br>
From the roof along the spire;<br>
Ah, the souls of those that die<br>
Are but sunbeams lifted higher.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Enter</i> PRINCE HENRY.)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Christ is arisen!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> Amen! he is arisen!<br>
His peace be with you!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Here it reigns forever!<br>
The peace of God, that passeth understanding,<br>
Reigns in these cloisters and these corridors,<br>
Are you Ernestus, Abbot of the convent?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> I am.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> And I Prince Henry of Hoheneck,<br>
Who crave your hospitality to-night.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> You are thrice welcome to our humble walls.<br>
You do us honor; and we shall requite it,<br>
I fear, but poorly, entertaining you<br>
With Paschal eggs, and our poor convent wine,<br>
The remnants of our Easter holidays.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> How fares it with the holy monks of Hirschau?<br>
Are all things well with them?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> All things are well.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> A noble convent! I have known it long<br>
By the report of travellers. I now see<br>
Their commendations lag behind the truth.<br>
You lie here in the valley of the Nagold<br>
As in a nest: and the still river, gliding<br>
Along its bed, is like an admonition<br>
How all things pass. Your lands are rich and ample,<br>
And your revenues large. God's benediction<br>
Rests on your convent.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> By our charities<br>
We strive to merit it. Our Lord and Master,<br>
When he departed, left us in his will,<br>
As our best legacy on earth, the poor!<br>
These we have always with us; had we not,<br>
Our hearts would grow as hard as are these stones.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> If I remember right, the Counts of Calva<br>
Founded your convent.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> Even as you say.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> And, if I err not, it is very old.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> Within these cloisters lie already buried<br>
Twelve holy Abbots. Underneath the flags<br>
On which we stand, the Abbot William lies,<br>
Of blessed memory.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> And whose tomb is that,<br>
Which bears the brass escutcheon?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> A benefactor's.<br>
Conrad, a Count of Calva, he who stood<br>
Godfather to our bells<p>.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Your monks are learned<br>
And holy men, I trust.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> There are among them<br>
Learned and holy men. Yet in this age<br>
We need another Hildebrand, to shake<br>
And purify us like a mighty wind.<br>
The world is wicked, and sometimes I wonder<br>
God does not lose his patience with it wholly,<br>
And shatter it like glass! Even here, at times,<br>
Within these walls, where all should be at peace,<br>
I have my trials. Time has laid his hand<br>
Upon my heart, gently, not smiting it,<br>
But as a harper lays his open palm<br>
Upon his harp, to deaden its vibrations.<br>
Ashes are on my head, and on my lips<br>
Sackcloth, and in my breast a heaviness<br>
And weariness of life, that makes me ready<br>
To say to the dead Abbots under us,<br>
&quot;Make room for me!&quot; Only I see the dusk<br>
Of evening twilight coming, and have not<br>
Completed half my task; and so at times<br>
The thought of my shortcomings in this life<br>
Falls like a shadow on the life to come.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> We must all die, and not the old alone;<br>
The young have no exemption from that doom.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> Ah, yes! the young may die, but the old must!<br>
That is the difference.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> I have heard much laud<br>
Of your transcribers. Your Scriptorium<br>
Is famous among all, your manuscripts<br>
Praised for their beauty and their excellence.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot.</i> That is indeed our boast. If you desire it,<br>
You shall behold these treasures. And meanwhile<br>
Shall the Refectorarius bestow<br>
Your horses and attendants for the night.<p></p>

<i>Vespers; after which the monks retire, a chorister
leading an old monk who is blind</i>.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> They are all gone, save one who lingers,<br>
Absorbed in deep and silent prayer.<br>
As if his heart could find no rest,<br>
At times he beats his heaving breast<br>
With clenched and convulsive fingers,<br>
Then lifts them trembling in the air.<br>
A chorister, with golden hair,<br>
Guides hitherward his heavy pace.<br>
Can it be so? Or does my sight<br>
Deceive me in the uncertain light?<br>
Ah no! I recognize that face,<br>
Though Time has touched it in his flight,<br>
And changed the auburn hair to white.<br>
It is Count Hugo of the Rhine,<br>
The deadliest foe of all our race,<br>
And hateful unto me and mine!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Blind Monk</i>. Who is it that doth stand so near<br>
His whispered words I almost hear?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. I am Prince Henry of Hoheneck,<br>
And you, Count Hugo of the Rhine!<br>
I know you, and I see the scar,<br>
The brand upon your forehead, shine<br>
And redden like a baleful star!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Blind Monk</i>. Count Hugo once, but now the wreck<br>
Of what I was. O Hoheneck!<br>
The passionate will, the pride, the wrath<br>
That bore me headlong on my path,<br>
Stumbled and staggered into fear,<br>
And failed me in my mad career,<br>
As a tired steed some evil-doer,<br>
Alone upon a desolate moor,<br>
Bewildered, lost, deserted, blind,<br>
And hearing loud and close behind<br>
The o'ertaking steps of his pursuer.<br>
Then suddenly, from the dark there came<br>
A voice that called me by my name,<br>
And said to me, &quot;Kneel down and pray!&quot;<br>
And so my terror passed away,<br>
Passed utterly away forever.<br>
Contrition, penitence, remorse,<br>
Came on me, with o'erwhelming force;<br>
A hope, a longing, an endeavor,<br>
By days of penance and nights of prayer,<br>
To frustrate and defeat despair!<br>
Calm, deep, and still is now my heart.<br>
With tranquil waters overflowed;<br>
A lake whose unseen fountains start,<br>
Where once the hot volcano glowed.<br>
And you, O Prince of Hoheneck!<br>
Have known me in that earlier time,<br>
A man of violence and crime,<br>
Whose passions brooked no curb nor check.<br>
Behold me now, in gentler mood,<br>
One of this holy brotherhood.<br>
Give me your hand; here let me kneel;<br>
Make your reproaches sharp as steel;<br>
Spurn me, and smite me on each cheek;<br>
No violence can harm the meek,<br>
There is no wound Christ cannot heal!<br>
Yes; lift your princely hand, and take<br>
Revenge, if 't is revenge you seek,<br>
Then pardon me, for Jesus' sake!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Arise, Count Hugo! let there be<br>
No farther strife nor enmity<br>
Between us twain; we both have erred!<br>
Too rash in act, too wroth in word,<br>
From the beginning have we stood<br>
In fierce, defiant attitude,<br>
Each thoughtless of the other's right,<br>
And each reliant on his might.<br>
But now our souls are more subdued;<br>
The hand of God, and not in vain,<br>
Has touched us with the fire of pain.<br>
Let us kneel down, and side by side<br>
Pray, till our souls are purified,<br>
And pardon will not be denied!<p></p>

As I happen to know he has guests of his own.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i> Who are they?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar John.</i> A German Prince and his train,<br>
Who arrived here just before the rain.<br>
There is with him a damsel fair to see,<br>
As slender and graceful as a reed!<br>
When she alighted from her steed,<br>
It seemed like a blossom blown from a tree.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i> None of your pale-faced girls for me!<br><p></p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Kisses the girl at his side</i>.)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar John.</i> Come, old fellow, drink down to your peg!<br>
do not drink any farther, I beg!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The days of old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cross of wood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bishop of gold!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert (to the girl).</i> What an infernal racket and din!<br>
No need not blush so, that's no sin.<br>
You look very holy in this disguise,<br>
Though there's something wicked in your eyes!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Paul (continues.)</i> Now we have changed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That law so good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cross of gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bishop of wood!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i> I like your sweet face under a hood.<br>
Sister! how came you into this way?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Girl.</i> It was you, Friar Cuthbert, who led me astray.<br>
Have you forgotten that day in June,<br>
When the church was so cool in the afternoon,<br>
And I came in to confess my sins?<br>
That is where my ruin begins.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar John.</i> What is the name of yonder friar,<br>
With an eye that glows like a coal of fire,<br>
And such a black mass of tangled hair?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Paul.</i> He who is sitting there,<br>
With a rollicking,<br>
Devil may care,<br>
Free and easy look and air,<br>
As if he were used to such feasting and frollicking?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar John.</i> The same.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Paul.</i> He's a stranger. You had better ask his name,<br>
And where he is going, and whence he came.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar John.</i> Hallo! Sir Friar!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Paul.</i> You must raise your voice a little higher,<br>
He does not seem to hear what you say.<br>
Now, try again! He is looking this way.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar John.</i> Hallo! Sir Friar,<br>
We wish to inquire<br>
Whence you came, and where you are going,<br>
And anything else that is worth the knowing.<br>
So be so good as to open your head.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> I am a Frenchman born and bred,<br>
Going on a pilgrimage to Rome.<br>
My home<br>
Is the convent of St. Gildas de Rhuys,<br>
Of which, very like, you never have heard.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monks.</i> Never a word!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> You must know, then, it is in the diocese<br>
Called the Diocese of Vannes,<br>
In the province of Brittany.<br>
From the gray rocks of Morbihan<br>
It overlooks the angry sea;<br>
The very seashore where,<br>
In his great despair,<br>
Abbot Abelard walked to and fro,<br>
Filling the night with woe,<br>
And wailing aloud to the merciless seas<br>
The name of his sweet Heloise!<br>
Whilst overhead<br>
The convent windows gleamed as red<br>
As the fiery eyes of the monks within,<br>
Who with jovial din<br>
Gave themselves up to all kinds of sin!<br>
Ha! that is a convent! that is an abbey!<br>
Over the doors,<br>
None of your death-heads carved in wood,<br>
None of your Saints looking pious and good,<br>
None of your Patriarchs old and shabby!<br>
But the heads and tusks of boars,<br>
And the cells<br>
Hung all round with the fells<br>
of the fallow-deer,<br>
And then what cheer!<br>
What jolly, fat friars,<br>
Sitting round the great, roaring fires,<br>
Roaring louder than they,<br>
With their strong wines,<br>
And their concubines,<br>
And never a bell,<br>
With its swagger and swell,<br>
Calling you up with a start of affright<br>
In the dead of night,<br>
To send you grumbling down dark stairs,<br>
To mumble your prayers,<br>
But the cheery crow<br>
Of cocks in the yard below,<br>
After daybreak, an hour or so,<br>
And the barking of deep-mouthed hounds,<br>
These are the sounds<br>
That, instead of bells, salute the ear.<br>
And then all day<br>
Up and away<br>
Through the forest, hunting the deer!<br>
Ah, my friends! I'm afraid that here<br>
You are a little too pious, a little too tame,<br>
And the more is the shame,<br>
It is the greatest folly<br>
Not to be jolly;<br>
That's what I think!<br>
Come, drink, drink,<br>
Drink, and die game!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monks,</i> And your Abbot What's-his-name?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Abelard!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monks.</i> Did he drink hard?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> O, no! Not he!<br>
He was a dry old fellow,<br>
Without juice enough to get thoroughly mellow.<br>
There he stood,<br>
Lowering at us in sullen mood,<br>
As if he had come into Brittany<br>
Just to reform our brotherhood!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>A roar of laughter</i>.)<br><p></p>

But you see<br>
It never would do!<br>
For some of us knew a thing or two,<br>
In the Abbey of St. Gildas de Rhuys!<br>
For instance, the great ado<br>
With old Fulbert's niece,<br>
The young and lovely Heloise!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar John.</i> Stop there, if you please,<br>
Till we drink to the fair Heloise.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>All (drinking and shouting).</i> Heloise! Heloise!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>The Chapel-bell tolls</i>.)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (starting).</i> What is that bell for? Are you such asses<br>
As to keep up the fashion of midnight masses?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i> It is only a poor, unfortunate brother,<br>
Who is gifted with most miraculous powers<br>
Of getting up at all sorts of hours,<br>
And, by way of penance and Christian meekness,<br>
Of creeping silently out of his cell<br>
To take a pull at that hideous bell;<br>
So that all the monks who are lying awake<br>
May murmur some kind of prayer for his sake,<br>
And adapted to his peculiar weakness!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar John.</i> From frailty and fall--<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>All.</i> Good Lord, deliver us all!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i> And before the bell for matins sounds,<br>
He takes his lantern, and goes the rounds,<br>
Flashing it into our sleepy eyes,<br>
Merely to say it is time to arise.<br>
But enough of that. Go on, if you please,<br>
With your story about St. Gildas de Rhuys.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Well, it finally came to pass<br>
That, half in fun and half in malice,<br>
One Sunday at Mass<br>
We put some poison into the chalice.<br>
But, either by accident or design,<br>
Peter Abelard kept away<br>
From the chapel that day,<br>
And a poor, young friar, who in his stead<br>
Drank the sacramental wine,<br>
Fell on the steps of the altar, dead!<br>
But look! do you see at the window there<br>
That face, with a look of grief and despair,<br>
That ghastly face, as of one in pain?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monks.</i> Who? where?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> As I spoke, it vanished away again.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i> It is that nefarious<br>
Siebald the Refectorarius.<br>
That fellow is always playing the scout,<br>
Creeping and peeping and prowling about;<br>
And then he regales<br>
The Abbot with Scandalous tales.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. A spy in the convent? One of the brothers<br>
Telling scandalous tales of the others?<br>
Out upon him, the lazy loon!<br>
I would put a stop to that pretty soon,<br>
In a way he should rue it.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monks</i>. How shall we do it?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. Do you, brother Paul,<br>
Creep under the window, close to the wall,<br>
And open it suddenly when I call.<br>
Then seize the villain by the hair,<br>
And hold him there,<br>
And punish him soundly, once for all.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert</i>. As St. Dustan of old,<br>
We are told,<br>
Once caught the Devil by the nose!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. Ha! ha! that story is very clever,<br>
But has no foundation whatsoever.<br>
Quick! for I see his face again<br>
Glaring in at the window pane;<br>
Now! now! and do not spare your blows.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (FRIAR PAUL <i>opens the window suddenly, and seizes</i> SIEBALD. <i>They beat him.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Siebald</i>. Help! help! are you going to slay me?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Paul</i>. That will teach you again to betray me!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Siebald</i>. Mercy! mercy!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Paul</i> (<i>shouting and beating</i>). Rumpas bellorum lorum,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vim confer amorum<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morum verorum, rorun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tu plena polorum!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>. Who stands in the doorway yonder,<br>
Stretching out his trembling hand,<br>
Just as Abelard used to stand,<br>
The flash of his keen, black eyes<br>
Forerunning the thunder?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Monks (in confusion)</i>. The Abbot! the<br>
Abbot!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert (to the girl)</i>. Put on your disguise!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Francis</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide the great flagon<br>
From the eyes of the dragon!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert</i>. Pull the brown hood over your face,<br>
Lest you bring me into disgrace!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abbot</i>. What means this revel and carouse?<br>
Is this a tavern and drinking-house?<br>
Are you Christian monks, or heathen devils,<br>
To pollute this convent with your revels?<br>
Were Peter Damian still upon earth,<br>
To be shocked by such ungodly mirth,<br>
He would write your names, with pen of gall,<br>
In his Book of Gomorrah, one and all!<br>
Away, you drunkards! to your cells,<br>
And pray till you hear the matin-bells;<br>
You, Brother Francis, and you, Brother Paul!<br>
And as a penance mark each prayer<br>
With the scourge upon your shoulders bare;<br>
Nothing atones for such a sin<br>
But the blood that follows the discipline.<br>
And you, Brother Cuthbert, come with me<br>
Alone into the sacristy;<br>
You, who should be a guide to your brothers,<br>
And are ten times worse than all the others,<br>
For you I've a draught that has long been brewing<br>
You shall do a penance worth the doing!<br>
Away to your prayers, then, one and all!<br>
I wonder the very, convent wall<br>
Does not crumble and crush you in its fall!<p></p>

<h2>THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.</h2>

<hr style="width: 25%;">

<i>The</i> ABBESS IRMINGARD <i>sitting with</i> ELSIE <i>in the
moonlight.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Irmingard</i> The night is silent, the wind is still,<br>
The moon is looking from yonder hill<br>
Down upon convent, and grove, and garden;<br>
The clouds have passed away from her face,<br>
Leaving behind them no sorrowful trace,<br>
Only the tender and quiet grace<br>
Of one, whose heart had been healed with pardon!<p></p>

And such am I. My soul within<br>
Was dark with passion and soiled with sin.<br>
But now its wounds are healed again;<br>
Gone are the anguish, the terror, and pain;<br>
For across that desolate land of woe,<br>
O'er whose burning sands I was forced to go,<br>
A wind from heaven began to blow;<br>
And all my being trembled and shook,<br>
As the leaves of the tree, or the grass of the field,<br>
And I was healed, as the sick are healed,<br>
When fanned by the leaves of the Holy Book!<p></p>

As thou sittest in the moonlight there,<br>
Its glory flooding thy golden hair,<br>
And the only darkness that which lies<br>
In the haunted chambers of thine eyes,<br>
I feel my soul drawn unto thee,<br>
Strangely, and strongly, and more and more,<br>
As to one I have known and loved before;<br>
For every soul is akin to me<br>
That dwells in the land of mystery!<br>
I am the Lady Irmingard,<br>
Born of a noble race and name!<br>
Many a wandering Suabian bard,<br>
Whose life was dreary, and bleak, and hard,<br>
Has found through me the way to fame.<br>
Brief and bright were those days, and the night<br>
Which followed was full of a lurid light.<br>
Love, that of every woman's heart<br>
Will have the whole, and not a part,<br>
That is to her, in Nature's plan,<br>
More than ambition is to man,<br>
Her light, her life, her very breath,<br>
With no alternative but death,<br>
Found me a maiden soft and young,<br>
Just from the convent's cloistered school,<br>
And seated on my lowly stool,<br>
Attentive while the minstrels sung.<p></p>

Gallant, graceful, gentle, tall,<br>
Fairest, noblest, best of all,<br>
Was Walter of the Vogelweid,<br>
And, whatsoever may betide,<br>
Still I think of him with pride!<br>
His song was of the summer-time<br>
The very birds sang in his rhyme;<br>
The sunshine, the delicious air,<br>
The fragrance of the flowers, were there,<br>
And I grew restless as I heard,<br>
Restless and buoyant as a bird,<br>
Down soft, a&euml;rial currents sailing,<br>
O'er blossomed orchards, and fields in bloom,<br>
And through the momentary gloom<br>
Of shadows o'er the landscape trailing,<br>
Yielding and borne I knew not where,<br>
But feeling resistance unavailing.<p></p>

And thus, unnoticed and apart,<br>
And more by accident than choice.<br>
I listened to that single voice<br>
Until the chambers of my heart<br>
Were filled with it by night and day,<br>
One night,--it was a night in May,--<br>
Within the garden, unawares,<br>
Under the blossoms in the gloom,<br>
I heard it utter my own name<br>
With protestations and wild prayers;<br>
And it rang through me, and became<br>
Like the archangel's trump of doom,<br>
Which the soul hears, and must obey;<br>
And mine arose as from a tomb.<br>
My former life now seemed to me<br>
Such as hereafter death may be,<br>
When in the great Eternity<br>
We shall awake and find it day.<p></p>

It was a dream, and would not stay;<br>
A dream, that in a single night<br>
Faded and vanished out of sight.<br>
My father's anger followed fast<br>
This passion, as a freshening blast<br>
Seeks out and fans the fire, whose rage<br>
It may increase, but not assuage.<br>
And he exclaimed: &quot;No wandering bard<br>
Shall win thy hand, O Irmingard!<br>
For which Prince Henry of Hoheneck<br>
By messenger and letter sues.&quot;<p></p>

Gently, but firmly, I replied:<br>
&quot;Henry of Hoheneck I discard!<br>
Never the hand of Irmingard<br>
Shall lie in his as the hand of a bride!&quot;<br>
This said I, Walter, for thy sake:<br>
This said I, for I could not choose.<br>
After a pause, my father spake<br>
In that cold and deliberate tone<br>
Which turns the hearer into stone,<br>
And seems itself the act to be<br>
That follows with such dread certainty;<br>
&quot;This, or the cloister and the veil!&quot;<br>
No other words than these he said,<br>
But they were like a funeral wail;<br>
My life was ended, my heart was dead.<p></p>

That night from the castle-gate went down,<br>
With silent, slow, and stealthy pace,<br>
Two shadows, mounted on shadowy steeds,<br>
Taking the narrow path that leads<br>
Into the forest dense and brown,<br>
In the leafy darkness of the place,<br>
One could not distinguish form nor face,<br>
Only a bulk without a shape,<br>
A darker shadow in the shade;<br>
One scarce could say it moved or stayed,<br>
Thus it was we made our escape!<br>
A foaming brook, with many a bound,<br>
Followed us like a playful hound;<br>
Then leaped before us, and in the hollow<br>
Paused, and waited for us to follow,<br>
And seemed impatient, and afraid<br>
That our tardy flight should be betrayed<br>
By the sound our horses' hoof-beats made,<br>
And when we reached the plain below,<br>
He paused a moment and drew rein<br>
To look back at the castle again;<br>
And we saw the windows all aglow<br>
With lights, that were passing to and fro;<br>
Our hearts with terror ceased to beat;<br>
The brook crept silent to our feet;<br>
We knew what most we feared to know.<br>
Then suddenly horns began to blow;<br>
And we heard a shout, and a heavy tramp,<br>
And our horses snorted in the damp<br>
Night-air of the meadows green and wide,<br>
And in a moment, side by side,<br>
So close, they must have seemed but one,<br>
The shadows across the moonlight run,<br>
And another came, and swept behind,<br>
Like the shadow of clouds before the wind!<p></p>

How I remember that breathless flight<br>
Across the moors, in the summer night!<br>
How under our feet the long, white road<br>
Backward like a river flowed,<br>
Sweeping with it fences and hedges,<br>
Whilst farther away, and overhead,<br>
Paler than I, with fear and dread,<br>
The moon fled with us, as we fled<br>
Along the forest's jagged edges!<p></p>

All this I can remember well;<br>
But of what afterward befell<br>
I nothing farther can recall<br>
Than a blind, desperate, headlong fall;<br>
The rest is a blank and darkness all.<br>
When I awoke out of this swoon,<br>
The sun was shining, not the moon,<br>
Making a cross upon the wall<br>
With the bars of my windows narrow and tall;<br>
And I prayed to it, as I had been wont to pray,<br>
From early childhood, day by day,<br>
Each morning, as in bed I lay!<br>
I was lying again in my own room!<br>
And I thanked God, in my fever and pain,<br>
That those shadows on the midnight plain<br>
Were gone, and could not come again!<br>
I struggled no longer with my doom!<br>
This happened many years ago.<br>
I left my father's home to come<br>
Like Catherine to her martyrdom,<br>
For blindly I esteemed it so.<br>
And when I heard the convent door<br>
Behind me close, to ope no more,<br>
I felt it smite me like a blow,<br>
Through all my limbs a shudder ran,<br>
And on my bruised spirit fell<br>
The dampness of my narrow cell<br>
As night-air on a wounded man,<br>
Giving intolerable pain.<p></p>

But now a better life began,<br>
I felt the agony decrease<br>
By slow degrees, then wholly cease,<br>
Ending in perfect rest and peace!<br>
It was not apathy, nor dulness,<br>
That weighed and pressed upon my brain,<br>
But the same passion I had given<br>
To earth before, now turned to heaven<br>
With all its overflowing fulness.<p></p>

Alas! the world is full of peril!<br>
The path that runs through the fairest meads,<br>
On the sunniest side of the valley, leads<br>
Into a region bleak and sterile!<br>
Alike in the high-born and the lowly,<br>
The will is feeble, and passion strong.<br>
We cannot sever right from wrong;<br>
Some falsehood mingles with all truth;<br>
Nor is it strange the heart of youth<br>
Should waver and comprehend but slowly<br>
The things that are holy and unholy!<p></p>

But in this sacred and calm retreat,<br>
We are all well and safely shielded<br>
From winds that blow, and waves that beat,<br>
From the cold, and rain, and blighting heat,<br>
To which the strongest hearts have yielded.<br>
Here we stand as the Virgins Seven,<br>
For our celestial bridegroom yearning;<br>
Our hearts are lamps forever burning,<br>
With a steady and unwavering flame,<br>
Pointing upward, forever the same,<br>
Steadily upward toward the Heaven!<p></p>

The moon is hidden behind a cloud;<br>
A sudden darkness fills the room,<br>
And thy deep eyes, amid the gloom,<br>
Shine like jewels in a shroud.<br>
On the leaves is a sound of falling rain;<br>
A bird, awakened in its nest,<br>
Gives a faint twitter of unrest,<br>
Then smoothes its plumes and sleeps again.<p></p>

No other sounds than these I hear;<br>
The hour of midnight must be near.<br>
Thou art o'erspent with the day's fatigue<br>
Of riding many a dusty league;<br>
Sink, then, gently to thy slumber;<br>
Me so many cares encumber,<br>
So many ghosts, and forms of fright,<br>
Have started from their graves to-night,<br>
They have driven sleep from mine eyes away:<br>
I will go down to the chapel and pray.<p></p>

<h2>A COVERED BRIDGE AT LUCERNE.</h2>


<hr style="width: 25%;">


&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. God's blessing on the architects who build<br>
The bridges o'er swift rivers and abysses<br>
Before impassable to human feet,<br>
No less than on the builders of cathedrals,<br>
Whose massive walls are bridges thrown across<br>
The dark and terrible abyss of Death.<br>
Well has the name of Pontifex been given<br>
Unto the Church's head, as the chief builder<br>
And architect of the invisible bridge<br>
That leads from earth to heaven.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i> How dark it grows!<br>
What are these paintings on the walls around us?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> The Dance Macaber!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i> What?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> The Dance of Death!<br>
All that go to and fro must look upon it,<br>
Mindful of what they shall be, while beneath,<br>
Among the wooden piles, the turbulent river<br>
Rushes, impetuous as the river of life,<br>
With dimpling eddies, ever green and bright,<br>
Save where the shadow of this bridge falls on it.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> O, yes! I see it now!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The grim musician<br>
Leads all men through the mazes of that dance,<br>
To different sounds in different measures moving;<br>
Sometimes he plays a lute, sometimes a drum,<br>
To tempt or terrify.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i> What is this picture?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> It is a young man singing to a nun,<br>
Who kneels at her devotions, but in kneeling<br>
Turns round to look at him, and Death, meanwhile,<br>
Is putting out the candles on the altar!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i> Ah, what a pity 't is that she should listen<br>
to such songs, when in her orisons<br>
She might have heard in heaven the angels singing!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here he has stolen a jester's cap and bells,<br>
And dances with the Queen.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i> A foolish jest!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;And here the heart of the new-wedded wife,<br>
Coming from church with her beloved lord,<br>
He startles with the rattle of his drum.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, that is sad! And yet perhaps 't is best<br>
That she should die, with all the sunshine on her,<br>
And all the benedictions of the morning,<br>
Before this affluence of golden light<br>
Shall fade into a cold and clouded gray,<br>
Then into darkness!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> Under it is written,<br>
&quot;Nothing but death shall separate thee and me!&quot;<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> And what is this, that follows close upon it?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i> Death, playing on a ducimer. Behind&nbsp;&nbsp;him,<br>
A poor old woman, with a rosary,<br>
Follows the sound, and seems to wish her feet<br>
Were swifter to o'ertake him. Underneath,<br>
The inscription reads, &quot;Better is Death than Life.&quot;<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Better is Death than Life! Ah yes! to thousands<br>
Death plays upon a dulcimer, and sings<br>
That song of consolation, till the air<br>
Rings with it, and they cannot choose but follow<br>
Whither he leads. And not the old alone,<br>
But the young also hear it, and are still.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in their sadder moments. 'T is the sound<br>
Of their own hearts they hear, half full of tears,<br>
Which are like crystal cups, half filled with water.<br>
Responding to the pressure of a finger<br>
With music sweet and low and melancholy.<br>
Let us go forward, and no longer stay<br>
In this great picture-gallery of Death!<br>
I hate it! ay, the very thought of it!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Why is it hateful to you?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> For the reason<br>
That life, and all that speaks of life, is lovely,<br>
And death, and all that speaks of death, is hateful.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> The grave is but a covered bridge,<br>
leading from light to light, through a brief darkness!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry (emerging from the bridge).</i> I breathe again more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freely! Ah, how pleasant<br>
To come once more into the light of day,<br>
Out of that shadow of death! To hear again<br>
The hoof-beats of our horses on firm ground,<br>
And not upon those hollow planks, resounding<br>
With a sepulchral echo, like the clods<br>
On coffins in a churchyard! Yonder lies<br>
The Lake of the Four Forest-Towns, apparelled<br>
In light, and lingering, like a village maiden,<br>
Hid in the bosom of her native mountains,<br>
Then pouring all her life into another's,<br>
Changing her name and being! Overhead,<br>
Shaking his cloudy tresses loose in air,<br>
Rises Pilatus, with his windy pines.<p></p>

PRINCE HENRY <i>and</i> ELSIE <i>crossing, with attendants.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Guide.</i> This bridge is called the Devil's Bridge.<br>
With a single arch, from ridge to ridge,<br>
It leaps across the terrible chasm<br>
Yawning beneath us, black and deep,<br>
As if, in some convulsive spasm,<br>
the summits of the hills had cracked,<br>
and made a road for the cataract,<br>
That raves and rages down the steep!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (under the bridge).</i> Ha! ha!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Guide.</i> Never any bridge but this<br>
Could stand across the wild abyss;<br>
All the rest, of wood or stone,<br>
By the Devil's hand were overthrown.<br>
He toppled crags from the precipice,<br>
And whatsoe'er was built by day<br>
In the night was swept away;<br>
None could stand but this alone.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (under the bridge).</i> Ha! ha!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Guide.</i> I showed you in the valley a boulder<br>
Marked with the imprint of his shoulder;<br>
As he was bearing it up this way,<br>
A peasant, passing, cried, &quot;Herr J&eacute;!&quot;<br>
And the Devil dropped it in his fright,<br>
And vanished suddenly out of sight!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (under the bridge).</i> Ha! ha!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Guide.</i> Abbot Giraldus of Einsiedel,<br>
For pilgrims on their way to Rome,<br>
Built this at last, with a single arch,<br>
Under which, on its endless march,<br>
Runs the river, white with foam,<br>
Like a thread through the eye of a needle.<br>
And the Devil promised to let it stand,<br>
Under compact and condition<br>
That the first living thing which crossed<br>
Should be surrendered into his hand,<br>
And be beyond redemption lost.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (under the bridge).</i> Ha! ha! perdition!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Guide.</i> At length, the bridge being all completed,<br>
The Abbot, standing at its head,<br>
Threw across it a loaf of bread,<br>
Which a hungry dog sprang after,<br>
And the rocks reechoed with peals of laughter<br>
To see the Devil thus defeated!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> This is the highest point. Two ways the rivers<br>
Leap down to different seas, and as they roll<br>
Grow deep and still, and their majestic presence<br>
Becomes a benefaction to the towns<br>
They visit, wandering silently among them,<br>
Like patriarchs old among their shining tents.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> How bleak and bare it is! Nothing but mosses<br>
Grow on these rocks.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Yet are they not forgotten;<br>
Beneficent Nature sends the mists to feed them.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> See yonder little cloud, that, borne aloft<br>
So tenderly by the wind, floats fast away<br>
Over the snowy peaks! It seems to me<br>
The body of St. Catherine, borne by angels!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Thou art St. Catherine, and invisible angels<br>
Bear thee across these chasms and precipices,<br>
Lest thou shouldst dash thy feet against a stone!<p></p>

Upon angelic shoulders! Even now<br>

Of Paradise!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, of Gethsemane<br>
To thee and me, of passion and of prayer!<br>
Yet once of Paradise. Long years ago<br>
I wandered as a youth among its bowers,<br>
And never from my heart has faded quite<br>
Its memory, that, like a summer sunset,<br>
Encircles with a ring of purple light<br>
All the horizon of my youth.<p></p>

Shadow and sunshine of the roadside trees,<br>

Inhale long draughts of this delicious breeze<br>
Our fleeter steeds have distanced our attendants;<br>
They lag behind us with a slower pace;<br>
We will await them under the green pendants<br>
Of the great willows in this shady place.<br>
Ho, Barbarossa! how thy mottled haunches<br>
Sweat with this canter over hill and glade!<br>
Stand still, and let these overhanging branches<br>
Fan thy hot sides and comfort thee with shade!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (as a Friar in the procession).</i> Here am I, too, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pious band,<br>
In the garb of a barefooted Carmelite dressed!<br>
The soles of my feet are as hard and tanned<br>
As the conscience of old Pope Hildebrand,<br>
The Holy Satan, who made the wives<br>
Of the bishops lead such shameful lives.<br>
All day long I beat my breast,<br>
And chaunt with a most particular zest<br>
The Latin hymns, which I understand<br>
Quite as well, I think, as the rest.<br>
And at night such lodging in barns and sheds,<br>
Such a hurly-burly in country inns,<br>
Such a clatter of tongues in empty heads,<br>
Such a helter-skelter of prayers and sins!<br>
Of all the contrivances of the time<br>
For sowing broadcast the seeds of crime,<br>
There is none so pleasing to me and mine<br>
As a pilgrimage to some far-off shrine!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> If from the outward man we judge the inner,<br>
And cleanliness is godliness, I fear<br>
A hopeless reprobate, a hardened sinner,<br>
Must be that Carmelite now passing near.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> There is my German Prince again,<br>
Thus far on his journey to Salern,<br>
And the lovesick girl, whose heated brain<br>
Is sowing the cloud to reap the rain;<br>
But it's a long road that has no turn!<br>
Let them quietly hold their way,<br>
I have also a part in the play.<br>
But first I must act to my heart's content<br>
This mummery and this merriment,<br>
And drive this motley flock of sheep<br>
Into the fold, where drink and sleep<br>
The jolly old friars of Benevent.<br>
Of a truth, it often provokes me to laugh<br>
To see these beggars hobble along,<br>
Lamed and maimed, and fed upon chaff,<br>
Chanting their wonderful piff and paff,<br>
And, to make up for not understanding the song,<br>
Singing it fiercely, and wild, and strong!<br>
Were it not for my magic garters and staff,<br>
And the goblets of goodly wine I quaff,<br>
And the mischief I make in the idle throng,<br>
I should not continue the business long.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pilgrims (chaunting).</i> In h&acirc;c uibe, lux solennis,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ver aeternum, pax perennis,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In h&acirc;c odor implens caelos,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In h&acirc;c semper festum melos!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Do you observe that monk among the train,<br>
Who pours from his great throat the roaring bass,<br>
As a cathedral spout pours out the rain,<br>
And this way turns his rubicund, round face?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> It is the same who, on the Strasburg square,<br>
Preached to the people in the open air.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> And he has crossed o'er mountain, field, and fell,<br>
On that good steed, that seems to bear him well,<br>
The hackney of the Friars of Orders Gray,<br>
His own stout legs! He, too, was in the play,<br>
Both as King Herod and Ben Israel.<br>
Good morrow, Friar!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morrow, noble Sir!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> I speak in German, for, unless I err,<br>
You are a German.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i> I cannot gainsay you.<br>
But by what instinct, or what secret sign,<br>
Meeting me here, do you straightway divine<br>
That northward of the Alps my country lies?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Your accent, like St, Peter's, would betray you,<br>
Did not your yellow beard and your blue eyes,<br>
Moreover, we have seen your face before,<br>
And heard you preach at the Cathedral door<br>
On Easter Sunday, in the Strasburg square<br>
We were among the crowd that gathered there,<br>
And saw you play the Rabbi with great skill,<br>
As if, by leaning o'er so many years<br>
To walk with little children, your own will<br>
Had caught a childish attitude from theirs,<br>
A kind of stooping in its form and gait,<br>
And could no longer stand erect and straight.<br>
Whence come you now?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the old monastery<br>
Of Hirschau, in the forest; being sent<br>
Upon a pilgrimage to Benevent,<br>
To see the image of the Virgin Mary,<br>
That moves its holy eyes, and sometimes speaks,<br>
And lets the piteous tears run down its cheeks,<br>
To touch the hearts of the impenitent.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;O, had I faith, as in the days gone by,<br>
That knew no doubt, and feared no mystery!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (at a distance).</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho, Cuthbert! Friar Cuthbert!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friar Cuthbert.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, Prince!<br>
I cannot stay to argue and convince.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> This is indeed the blessed Mary's land,<br>
Virgin and Mother of our dear Redeemer!<br>
All hearts are touched and softened at her name;<br>
Alike the bandit, with the bloody hand,<br>
The priest, the prince, the scholar, and the peasant,<br>
The man of deeds, the visionary dreamer,<br>
Pay homage to her as one ever present!<br>
And even as children, who have much offended<br>
A too indulgent father, in great shame,<br>
Penitent, and yet not daring unattended<br>
To go into his presence, at the gate<br>
Speak with their sister, and confiding wait<br>
Till she goes in before and intercedes;<br>
So men, repenting of their evil deeds,<br>
And yet not venturing rashly to draw near<br>
With their requests an angry father's ear,<br>
Offer to her their prayers and their confession,<br>
And she for them in heaven makes intercession.<br>
And if our Faith had given us nothing more<br>
Than this example of all womanhood,<br>
So mild, so merciful, so strong, so good,<br>
So patient, peaceful, loyal, loving, pure,<br>
This were enough to prove it higher and truer<br>
Than all the creeds the world had known before.<p></p>

<h2>THE INN AT GENOA.</h2>


<hr style="width: 25%;">

<i>A terrace overlooking the sea. Night.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> It is the sea, it is the sea,<br>
In all its vague immensity,<br>
Fading and darkening in the distance!<br>
Silent, majestical, and slow,<br>
The white ships haunt it to and fro,<br>
With all their ghostly sails unfurled,<br>
As phantoms from another world<br>
Haunt the dim confines of existence!<br>
But ah! how few can comprehend<br>
Their signals, or to what good end<br>
From land to land they come and go!<br>
Upon a sea more vast and dark<br>
The spirits of the dead embark,<br>
All voyaging to unknown coasts.<br>
We wave our farewells from the shore,<br>
And they depart, and come no more,<br>
Or come as phantoms and as ghosts.<p></p>

Above the darksome sea of death<br>
Looms the great life that is to be,<br>
A land of cloud and mystery,<br>
A dim mirage, with shapes of men<br>
Long dead, and passed beyond our ken.<br>
Awe-struck we gaze, and hold our breath<br>
Till the fair pageant vanisheth,<br>
Leaving us in perplexity,<br>
And doubtful whether it has been<br>
A vision of the world unseen,<br>
Or a bright image of our own<br>
Against the sky in vapors thrown.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer (singing from the sea)</i>. Thou didst not make it, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; canst not mend it,<br>
But thou hast the power to end it!<br>
The sea is silent, the sea is discreet,<br>
Deep it lies at thy very feet;<br>
There is no confessor like unto Death!<br>
Thou canst not see him, but he is near;<br>
Thou needest not whisper above thy breath,<br>
And he will hear;<br>
He will answer the questions,<br>
The vague surmises and suggestions,<br>
That fill thy soul with doubt and fear!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry</i>. The fisherman, who lies afloat,<br>
With shadowy sail, in yonder boat,<br>
Is singing softly to the Night!<br>
But do I comprehend aright<br>
The meaning of the words he sung<br>
So sweetly in his native tongue?<br>
Ah, yes! the sea is still and deep.<br>
All things within its bosom sleep!<br>
A single step, and all is o'er;<br>
A plunge, a bubble, and no more;<br>
And thou, dear Elsie, wilt be free<br>
From martyrdom and agony.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie (coming from her chamber upon the terrace).</i><br>
The night is calm and cloudless,<br>
And still as still can be,<br>
And the stars come forth to listen<br>
To the music of the sea.<br>
They gather, and gather, and gather,<br>
Until they crowd the sky,<br>
And listen, in breathless silence,<br>
To the solemn litany.<br>
It begins in rocky caverns,<br>
As a voice that chaunts alone<br>
To the pedals of the organ<br>
In monotonous undertone;<br>
And anon from shelving beaches,<br>
And shallow sands beyond,<br>
In snow-white robes uprising<br>
The ghostly choirs respond.<br>
And sadly and unceasing<br>
The mournful voice sings on,<br>
And the snow-white choirs still answer<br>
Christe eleison!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Angel of God! thy finer sense perceives<br>
Celestial and perpetual harmonies!<br>
Thy purer soul, that trembles and believes,<br>
Hears the archangel's trumpet in the breeze,<br>
And where the forest rolls, or ocean heaves,<br>
Cecilia's organ sounding in the seas,<br>
And tongues of prophets speaking in the leaves.<br>
But I hear discord only and despair,<br>
And whispers as of demons in the air!<p></p>

<h2>AT SEA.</h2>


<hr style="width: 25%;">

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Il Padrone.</i> The wind upon our quarter lies,<br>
And on before the freshening gale,<br>
That fills the snow-white lateen sail,<br>
Swiftly our light felucca flies.<br>
Around, the billows burst and foam;<br>
They lift her o'er the sunken rock,<br>
They beat her sides with many a shock,<br>
And then upon their flowing dome<br>
They poise her, like a weathercock!<br>
Between us and the western skies<br>
The hills of Corsica arise;<br>
Eastward, in yonder long, blue line,<br>
The summits of the Apennine,<br>
And southward, and still far away,<br>
Salerno, on its sunny bay.<br>
You cannot see it, where it lies.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Ah, would that never more mine eyes<br>
Might see its towers by night or day!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Behind us, dark and awfully,<br>
There comes a cloud out of the sea,<br>
That bears the form of a hunted deer,<br>
With hide of brown, and hoofs of black,<br>
And antlers laid upon its back,<br>
And fleeing fast and wild with fear,<br>
As if the hounds were on its track!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Lo! while we gaze, it breaks and falls<br>
In shapeless masses, like the walls<br>
Of a burnt city. Broad and red<br>
The fires of the descending sun<br>
Glare through the windows, and o'erhead,<br>
Athwart the vapors, dense and dun,<br>
Long shafts of silvery light arise,<br>
Like rafters that support the skies!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> See! from its summit the lurid levin<br>
Flashes downward without warning,<br>
As Lucifer, son of the morning,<br>
Fell from the battlements of heaven!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Il Padrone.</i> I must entreat you, friends, below!<br>
The angry storm begins to blow,<br>
For the weather changes with the moon.<br>
All this morning, until noon,<br>
We had baffling winds, and sudden flaws<br>
Struck the sea with their cat's-paws.<br>
Only a little hour ago<br>
I was whistling to Saint Antonio<br>
For a capful of wind to fill our sail,<br>
And instead of a breeze he has sent a gale.<br>
Last night I saw St. Elmo's stars,<br>
With their glimmering lanterns, all at play<br>
On the tops of the masts and the tips of the spars,<br>
And I knew we should have foul weather to-day.<br>
Cheerily, my hearties! yo heave ho!<br>
Brail up the mainsail, and let her go<br>
As the winds will and Saint Antonio!<p></p>

Do you see that Livornese felucca,<br>
That vessel to the windward yonder,<br>
Running with her gunwale under?<br>
I was looking when the wind o'ertook her,<br>
She had all sail set, and the only wonder<br>
Is that at once the strength of the blast<br>
Did not carry away her mast.<br>
She is a galley of the Gran Duca,<br>
That, through the fear of the Algerines,<br>
Convoys those lazy brigantines,<br>
Laden with wine and oil from Lucca.<br>
Now all is ready, high and low;<br>
Blow, blow, good Saint Antonio!<p></p>

Ha! that is the first dash of the rain,<br>
With a sprinkle of spray above the rails,<br>
Just enough to moisten our sails,<br>
And make them ready for the strain.<br>
See how she leaps, as the blasts o'ertake her,<br>
And speeds away with a bone in her mouth!<br>
Now keep her head toward the south,<br>
And there is no danger of bank or breaker.<br>
With the breeze behind us, on we go;<br>
Not too much, good Saint Antonio!<p></p>

<h2>THE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.</h2>

<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br>
<i>A traveling Scholastic affixing his Theses to the gate
of the College.</i><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Scholastic.</i> There, that is my gauntlet, my banner, my shield,<br>
Hung up as a challenge to all the field!<br>
One hundred and twenty-five propositions,<br>
Which I will maintain with the sword of the tongue<br>
Against all disputants, old and young.<br>
Let us see if doctors or dialecticians<br>
Will dare to dispute my definitions,<br>
Or attack any one of my learned theses.<br>
Here stand I; the end shall be as God pleases.<br>
I think I have proved, by profound research<br>
The error of all those doctrines so vicious<br>
Of the old Areopagite Dionysius,<br>
That are making such terrible work in the churches,<br>
By Michael the Stammerer sent from the East,<br>
And done into Latin by that Scottish beast,<br>
Erigena Johannes, who dares to maintain,<br>
In the face of the truth, the error infernal,<br>
That the universe is and must be eternal;<br>
At first laying down, as a fact fundamental,<br>
That nothing with God can be accidental;<br>
Then asserting that God before the creation<br>
Could not have existed, because it is plain<br>
That, had he existed, he would have created;<br>
Which is begging the question that should be debated,<br>
And moveth me less to anger than laughter.<br>
All nature, he holds, is a respiration<br>
Of the Spirit of God, who, in breathing, hereafter<br>
Will inhale it into his bosom again,<br>
So that nothing but God alone will remain.<br>
And therein he contradicteth himself;<br>
For he opens the whole discussion by stating,<br>
That God can only exist in creating.<br>
That question I think I have laid on the shelf!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He goes out. Two Doctors come in disputing, and followed by pupils.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Doctor Serafino.</i> I, with the Doctor Seraphic, maintain,<br>
That a word which is only conceived in the brain<br>
Is a type of eternal Generation;<br>
The spoken word is the Incarnation.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Doctor Cherubino.</i> What do I care for the Doctor Seraphic,<br>
With all his wordy chaffer and traffic?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Doctor Serafino.</i> You make but a paltry show of resistance;<br>
Universals have no real existence!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Doctor Cherubino.</i> Your words are but idle and empty chatter;<br>
Ideas are eternally joined to matter!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Doctor Serafino</i>. May the Lord have mercy on your position,<br>
You wretched, wrangling culler of herbs!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Doctor Cherubino</i>. May he send your soul to eternal perdition,<br>
For your Treatise on the Irregular Verbs!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>They rush out fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Scholars come in.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>First Scholar</i>. Monte Cassino, then, is your College.<br>
What think you of ours here at Salern?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Second Scholar</i>. To tell the truth, I arrived so lately,<br>
I hardly yet have had time to discern.<br>
So much, at least, I am bound to acknowledge:<br>
The air seems healthy, the buildings stately,<br>
And on the whole I like it greatly.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>First Scholar</i>. Yes, the air is sweet; the Calabrian hills<br>
Send us down puffs of mountain air;<br>
And in summer time the sea-breeze fills<br>
With its coolness cloister, and court, and square.<br>
Then at every season of the year<br>
There are crowds of guests and travellers here;<br>
Pilgrims, and mendicant friars, and traders<br>
From the Levant, with figs and wine,<br>
And bands of wounded and sick Crusaders,<br>
Coming back from Palestine.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Second Scholar</i>. And what are the studies you pursue?<br>
What is the course you here go through?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>First Scholar</i>. The first three years of the college course<br>
Are given to Logic alone, as the source<br>
Of all that is noble, and wise, and true.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Second Scholar</i>. That seems rather strange, I must confess.<br>
In a Medical School; yet, nevertheless,<br>
You doubtless have reasons for that.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>First Scholar</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes!<br>
For none but a clever dialectician<br>
Can hope to become a great physician;<br>
That has been settled long ago.<br>
Logic makes an important part<br>
Of the mystery of the healing art;<br>
For without it how could you hope to show<br>
That nobody knows so much as you know?<br>
After this there are five years more<br>
Devoted wholly to medicine,<br>
With lectures on chirurgical lore,<br>
And dissections of the bodies of swine,<br>
As likest the human form divine.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Second Scholar</i>. What are the books now most in vogue?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>First Scholar</i>. Quite an extensive catalogue;<br>
Mostly, however, books of our own;<br>
As Gariopontus' Passionarius,<br>
And the writings of Matthew Platearius;<br>
And a volume universally known<br>
As the Regimen of the School of Salern,<br>
For Robert of Normandy written in terse<br>
And very elegant Latin verse.<br>
Each of these writings has its turn.<br>
And when at length we have finished these,<br>
Then comes the struggle for degrees,<br>
With all the oldest and ablest critics;<br>
The public thesis and disputation,<br>
Question, and answer, and explanation<br>
Of a passage out of Hippocrates,<br>
Or Aristotle's Analytics.<br>
There the triumphant Magister stands!<br>
A book is solemnly placed in his hands,<br>
On which he swears to follow the rule<br>
And ancient forms of the good old School;<br>
To report if any confectionarius<br>
Mingles his drugs with matters various,<br>
And to visit his patients twice a day,<br>
And once in the night, if they live in town,<br>
And if they are poor, to take no pay.<br>
Having faithfully promised these,<br>
His head is crowned with a laurel crown;<br>
A kiss on his cheek, a ring on his hand,<br>
The Magister Artium et Physices<br>
Goes forth from the school like a lord of the land.<br>
And now, as we have the whole morning before us<br>
Let us go in, if you make no objection,<br>
And listen awhile to a learned prelection<br>
On Marcus Aurelius Cassiodorus.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>They go in. Enter</i> LUCIFER <i>as a Doctor.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the great School of Salern!<br>
A land of wrangling and of quarrels,<br>
Of brains that seethe, and hearts that burn,<br>
Where every emulous scholar hears,<br>
In every breath that comes to his ears,<br>
The rustling of another's laurels!<br>
The air of the place is called salubrious;<br>
The neighborhood of Vesuvius lends it<br>
An odor volcanic, that rather mends it,<br>
And the buildings have an aspect lugubrious,<br>
That inspires a feeling of awe and terror<br>
Into the heart of the beholder,<br>
And befits such an ancient homestead of error,<br>
Where the old falsehoods moulder and smoulder,<br>
And yearly by many hundred hands<br>
Are carried away, in the zeal of youth,<br>
And sown like tares in the field of truth,<br>
To blossom and ripen in other lands.<br>
What have we here, affixed to the gate?<br>
The challenge of some scholastic wight,<br>
Who wishes to hold a public debate<br>
On sundry questions wrong or right!<br>
Ah, now this is my great delight!<br>
For I have often observed of late<br>
That such discussions end in a fight.<br>
Let us see what the learned wag maintains<br>
With such a prodigal waste of brains.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Reads.</i>)<br><p></p>

&quot;Whether angels in moving from place to place<br>
Pass through the intermediate space.<br>
Whether God himself is the author of evil,<br>
Or whether that is the work of the Devil.<br>
When, where, and wherefore Lucifer fell,<br>
And whether he now is chained in hell.&quot;<p></p>

I think I can answer that question well!<br>
So long as the boastful human mind<br>
Consents in such mills as this to grind,<br>
I sit very firmly upon my throne!<br>
Of a truth it almost makes me laugh,<br>
To see men leaving the golden grain<br>
To gather in piles the pitiful chaff<br>
That old Peter Lombard thrashed with his brain,<br>
To have it caught up and tossed again<br>
On the horns of the Dumb Ox of Cologne!<p></p>

But my guests approach! there is in the air<br>
A fragrance, like that of the Beautiful Garden<br>
Of Paradise, in the days that were!<br>
An odor of innocence, and of prayer,<br>
And of love, and faith that never fails,<br>
Which as the fresh-young heart exhales<br>
Before it begins to wither and harden!<br>
I cannot breathe such an atmosphere!<br>
My soul is filled with a nameless fear,<br>
That, after all my trouble and pain,<br>
After all my restless endeavor,<br>
The youngest, fairest soul of the twain,<br>
The most ethereal, most divine,<br>
Will escape from my hands forever and ever.<br>
But the other is already mine!<br>
Let him live to corrupt his race,<br>
Breathing among them, with every breath,<br>
Weakness, selfishness, and the base<br>
And pusillanimous fear of death.<br>
I know his nature, and I know<br>
That of all who in my ministry<br>
Wander the great earth to and fro,<br>
And on my errands come and go,<br>
The safest and subtlest are such as he.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Enter</i> PRINCE HENRY <i>and</i> ELSIE <i>with attendants</i>.)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Can you direct us to Friar Angelo?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> He stands before you.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Then you know our purpose.<br>
I am Prince Henry of Hoheneck, and this<br>
The maiden that I spake of in my letters.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> It is a very grave and solemn business!<br>
We must not be precipitate. Does she<br>
Without compulsion, of her own free will,<br>
Consent to this?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Against all opposition,<br>
Against all prayers, entreaties, protestations.<br>
She will not be persuaded.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> That is strange!<br>
Have you thought well of it?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; I come not here<br>
To argue, but to die. Your business is not<br>
to question, but to kill me. I am ready.<br>
I am impatient to be gone from here<br>
Ere any thoughts of earth disturb again<br>
The spirit of tranquillity within me.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Would I had not come here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would I were dead,<br>
And thou wert in thy cottage in the forest,<br>
And hadst not known me! Why have I done this?<br>
Let me go back and die.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> It cannot be;<br>
Not if these cold, flat stones on which we tread<br>
Were coulters heated white, and yonder gateway<br>
Flamed like a furnace with a sevenfold heat.<br>
I must fulfil my purpose.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> I forbid it!<br>
Not one step farther. For I only meant<br>
To put thus far thy courage to the proof.<br>
It is enough. I, too, have courage to die,<br>
For thou hast taught me!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> O my Prince! remember<br>
Your promises. Let me fulfill my errand.<br>
You do not look on life and death as I do.<br>
There are two angels, that attend unseen<br>
Each one of us, and in great books record<br>
Our good and evil deeds. He who writes down<br>
The good ones, after every action closes<br>
His volume, and ascends with it to God.<br>
The other keeps his dreadful day-book open<br>
Till sunset, that we may repent; which doing,<br>
The record of the action fades away,<br>
And leaves a line of white across the page.<br>
Now if my act be good, as I believe it,<br>
It cannot be recalled. It is already<br>
Sealed up in heaven, as a good deed accomplished.<br>
The rest is yours. Why wait you? I am ready.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>To her attendants.</i>)<br><p></p>

Weep not, my friends! rather rejoice with me.<br>
I shall not feel the pain, but shall be gone,<br>
And you will have another friend in heaven.<br>
Then start not at the creaking of the door<br>
Through which I pass. I see what lies beyond it.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>To</i> PRINCE HENRY.)<br><p></p>

And you, O Prince! bear back my benison<br>
Unto my father's house, and all within it.<br>
This morning in the church I prayed for them,<br>
After confession, after absolution,<br>
When my whole soul was white, I prayed for them.<br>
God will take care of them, they need me not.<br>
And in your life let my remembrance linger,<br>
As something not to trouble and disturb it,<br>
But to complete it, adding life to life.<br>
And if at times beside the evening fire<br>
You see my face among the other faces,<br>
Let it not be regarded as a ghost<br>
That haunts your house, but as a guest that loves you.<br>
Nay, even as one of your own family,<br>
Without whose presence there were something wanting.<br>
I have no more to say. Let us go in.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Friar Angelo! I charge you on your life,<br>
Believe not what she says, for she is mad,<br>
And comes here not to die, but to be healed.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Alas! Prince Henry!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lucifer.</i> Come with me; this way.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ELSIE <i>goes in with</i> LUCIFER, <i>who thrusts</i> PRINCE HENRY <i>back and closes the door.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Gone! and the light of all my life gone with her!<br>
A sudden darkness falls upon the world!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i> News from the Prince!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Of death or life?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i> You put your questions eagerly!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Answer me, then!&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the Prince?<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i> I left him only two hours since<br>
Homeward returning down the river,<br>
As strong and well as if God, the Giver,<br>
Had given him back in his youth again.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula (despairing).</i> Then Elsie, my poor child, is dead!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;That, my good woman, I have not said.<br>
Don't cross the bridge till you come to it,<br>
Is a proverb old, and of excellent wit.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Keep me no longer in this pain!<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i> It is true your daughter is no more;--<br>
That is, the peasant she was before.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Alas! I am simple and lowly bred<br>
I am poor, distracted, and forlorn.<br>
And it is not well that you of the court<br>
Should mock me thus, and make a sport<br>
Of a joyless mother whose child is dead,<br>
For you, too, were of mother, born!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i> Your daughter lives, and the Prince is well!<br>
You will learn ere long how it all befell.<br>
Her heart for a moment never failed;<br>
But when they reached Salerno's gate,<br>
The Prince's nobler self prevailed,<br>
And saved her for a nobler fate,<br>
And he was healed, in his despair,<br>
By the touch of St. Matthew's sacred bones;<br>
Though I think the long ride in the open air,<br>
That pilgrimage over stocks and stones,<br>
In the miracle must come in for a share!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Virgin! who lovest the poor and lonely,<br>
If the loud cry of a mother's heart<br>
Can ever ascend to where thou art,<br>
Into thy blessed hands and holy<br>
Receive my prayer of praise and thanksgiving!<br>
Let the hands that bore our Saviour bear it<br>
Into the awful presence of God;<br>
For thy feet with holiness are shod,<br>
And if thou bearest it he will hear it.<br>
Our child who was dead again is living!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i> I did not tell you she was dead;<br>
If you thought so 'twas no fault of mine;<br>
At this very moment, while I speak,<br>
They are sailing homeward down the Rhine,<br>
In a splendid barge, with golden prow,<br>
And decked with banners white and red<br>
As the colors on your daughter's cheek.<br>
They call her the Lady Alicia now;<br>
For the Prince in Salerno made a vow<br>
That Elsie only would he wed.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> Jesu Maria! what a change!<br>
All seems to me so weird and strange!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i> I saw her standing on the deck,<br>
Beneath an awning cool and shady;<br>
Her cap of velvet could not hold<br>
The tresses of her hair of gold,<br>
That flowed and floated like the stream,<br>
And fell in masses down her neck.<br>
As fair and lovely did she seem<br>
As in a story or a dream<br>
Some beautiful and foreign lady.<br>
And the Prince looked so grand and proud,<br>
And waved his hand thus to the crowd<br>
That gazed and shouted from the shore,<br>
All down the river, long and loud.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ursula.</i> We shall behold our child once more;<br>
She is not dead! She is not dead!<br>
God, listening, must have overheard<br>
The prayers, that, without sound or word,<br>
Our hearts in secrecy have said!<br>
O, bring me to her; for mine eyes<br>
Are hungry to behold her face;<br>
My very soul within me cries;<br>
My very hands seem to caress her,<br>
To see her, gaze at her, and bless her;<br>
Dear Elsie, child of God and grace!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>Goes out toward the garden.</i>)<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forester.</i> There goes the good woman out of her head;<br>
And Gottlieb's supper is waiting here;<br>
A very capacious flagon of beer,<br>
And a very portentous loaf of bread.<br>
One would say his grief did not much oppress him.<br>
Here's to the health of the Prince, God bless him!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>He drinks.</i>)<br><p></p>

Ha! it buzzes and stings like a hornet!<br>
And what a scene there, through the door!<br>
The forest behind and the garden before,<br>
And midway an old man of threescore,<br>
With a wife and children that caress him.<br>
Let me try still further to cheer and adorn it<br>
With a merry, echoing blast of my cornet!<p></p>

<h2>THE CASTLE OF VAUTSBERG ON THE RHINE.</h2>


<hr style="width: 25%;">

PRINCE HENRY <i>and</i> ELSIE <i>standing on the terrace at
evening. The sound of bells heard from a distance.</i><p></p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> We are alone. The wedding guests<br>
Ride down the hill, with plumes and cloaks,<br>
And the descending dark invests<br>
The Niederwald, and all the nests<br>
Among its hoar and haunted oaks.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> What bells are those, that ring so slow,<br>
So mellow, musical, and low?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> They are the bells of Geisenheim,<br>
That with their melancholy chime<br>
Ring out the curfew of the sun.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Listen, beloved.<br><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> They are done!<br>
Dear Elsie! many years ago<br>
Those same soft bells at eventide<br>
Rang in the ears of Charlemagne,<br>
As, seated by Fastrada's side<br>
At Ingelheim, in all his pride<br>
He heard their sound with secret pain.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Their voices only speak to me<br>
Of peace and deep tranquillity,<br>
And endless confidence in thee!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Thou knowest the story of her ring,<br>
How, when the court went back to Aix,<br>
Fastrada died; and how the king<br>
Sat watching by her night and day,<br>
Till into one of the blue lakes,<br>
That water that delicious land,<br>
They cast the ring, drawn from her hand;<br>
And the great monarch sat serene<br>
And sad beside the fated shore,<br>
Nor left the land forever more.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> That was true love.<br<p>></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> For him the queen<br>
Ne'er did what thou hast done for me.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Wilt thou as fond and faithful be?<br>
Wilt thou so love me after death?<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> In life's delight, in death's dismay,<br>
In storm and sunshine, night and day,<br>
In health, in sickness, in decay,<br>
Here and hereafter, I am thine!<br>
Thou hast Fastrada's ring. Beneath<br>
The calm, blue waters of thine eyes<br>
Deep in thy steadfast soul it lies,<br>
And, undisturbed by this world's breath,<br>
With magic light its jewels shine!<br>
This golden ring, which thou hast worn<br>
Upon thy finger since the morn,<br>
Is but a symbol and a semblance,<br>
An outward fashion, a remembrance,<br>
Of what thou wearest within unseen,<br>
O my Fastrada, O my queen!<br>
Behold! the hilltops all aglow<br>
With purple and with amethyst;<br>
While the whole valley deep below<br>
Is filled, and seems to overflow,<br>
With a fast-rising tide of mist.<br>
The evening air grows damp and chill;<br>
Let us go in.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elsie.</i> Ah, not so soon.<br>
See yonder fire! It is the moon<br>
Slow rising o'er the eastern hill.<br>
It glimmers on the forest tips,<br>
And through the dewy foliage drips<br>
In little rivulets of light,<br>
And makes the heart in love with night.<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prince Henry.</i> Oft on this terrace, when the day<br>
Was closing, have I stood and gazed,<br>
And seen the landscape fade away,<br>
And the white vapors rise and drown<br>
Hamlet and vineyard, tower and town<br>
While far above the hilltops blazed.<br>
But men another hand than thine<br>
Was gently held and clasped in mine;<br>
Another head upon my breast<br>
Was laid, as thine is now, at rest.<br>
Why dost thou lift those tender eyes<br>
With so much sorrow and surprise?<br>
A minstrel's, not a maiden's hand,<br>
Was that which in my own was pressed.<br>
A manly form usurped thy place,<br>
A beautiful, but bearded face,<br>
That now is in the Holy Land,<br>
Yet in my memory from afar<br>
Is shining on us like a star.<br>
But linger not. For while I speak,<br>
A sheeted spectre white and tall,<br>
The cold mist climbs the castle wall,<br>
And lays his hand upon thy cheek!<p></p>

<hr style="width: 25%;">

<h2>THE TWO RECORDING ANGELS ASCENDING.</h2>

<hr style="width: 25%;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Angel of Good Deeds</i> (<i>with closed book</i>). God sent his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;messenger the rain,<br>
And said unto the mountain brook,<br>
&quot;Rise up, and from thy caverns look<br>
And leap, with naked, snow-white feet.<br>
From the cool hills into the heat<br>
Of the broad, arid plain.&quot;<p></p>

God sent his messenger of faith,<br>
And whispered in the maiden's heart,<br>
&quot;Rise up, and look from where thou art,<br>
And scatter with unselfish hands<br>
Thy freshness on the barren sands<br>
And solitudes of Death.&quot;<br>
O beauty of holiness,<br>
Of self-forgetfulness, of lowliness!<br>
O power of meekness,<br>
Whose very gentleness and weakness<br>
Are like the yielding, but irresistible air!<br>
Upon the pages<br>
Of the sealed volume that I bear,<br>
The deed divine<br>
Is written in characters of gold,<br>
That never shall grow old,<br>
But all through ages<br>
Burn and shine,<br>
With soft effulgence!<br>
O God! it is thy indulgence<br>
That fills the world with the bliss<br>
Of a good deed like this!<p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Angel of Evil Deeds (with open book).</i> Not yet, not yet<br>
Is the red sun wholly set,<br>
But evermore recedes,<br>
While open still I bear<br>
The Book of Evil Deeds,<br>
To let the breathings of the upper air<br>
Visit its pages and erase<br>
The records from its face!<br>
Fainter and fainter as I gaze<br>
On the broad blaze<br>
The glimmering landscape shines,<br>
And below me the black river<br>
Is hidden by wreaths of vapor!<br>
Fainter and fainter the black lines<br>
Begin to quiver<br>
Along the whitening surface of the paper;<br>
Shade after shade<br>
The terrible words grow faint and fade,<br>
And in their place<br>
Runs a white space!<p></p>

Down goes the sun!<br>
But the soul of one,<br>
Who by repentance<br>
Has escaped the dreadful sentence,<br>
Shines bright below me as I look.<br>
It is the end!<br>
With closed Book<br>
To God do I ascend.<p></p>

Lo! over the mountain steeps<br>
A dark, gigantic shadow sweeps<br>
Beneath my feet;<br>
A blackness inwardly brightening<br>
With sullen heat,<br>
As a storm-cloud lurid with lightning.<br>
And a cry of lamentation,<br>
Repeated and again repeated,<br>
Deep and loud<br>
As the reverberation<br>
Of cloud answering unto cloud,<br>
Swells and rolls away in the distance,<br>
As if the sheeted<br>
Lightning retreated,<br>
Baffled and thwarted by the wind's resistance.<p></p>

It is Lucifer,<br>
The son of mystery;<br>
And since God suffers him to be,<br>
He, too, is God's minister,<br>
And labors for some good<br>
By us not understood!<p></p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
